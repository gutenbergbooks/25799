<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE THRESHOLD OF ADVENTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>The roar of State Street filled the ears of Robert
Orme not unpleasantly. He liked Chicago, felt
towards the Western city something more than the
tolerant, patronizing interest which so often characterizes
the Eastern man. To him it was the
hub of genuine Americanism&mdash;young, aggressive,
perhaps a bit too cocksure, but ever bounding
along with eyes toward the future. Here was the
city of great beginnings, the city of experiment&mdash;experiment
with life; hence its incompleteness&mdash;an
incompleteness not dissimilar to that of life
itself. Chicago lived; it was the pulse of the
great Middle West.
</p>
<p>Orme watched the procession with clear eyes.
He had been strolling southward from the Masonic
Temple, into the shopping district. The
clangor, the smoke and dust, the hurrying crowds,
all worked into his mood. The expectation of
adventure was far from him. Nor was he a man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
who sought impressions for amusement; whatever
came to him he weighed, and accepted or rejected
according as it was valueless or useful.
Wholesome he was; anyone might infer that from
his face. Doubtless, his fault lay in his overemphasis
on the purely practical; but that, after all,
was a lawyer&#8217;s fault, and it was counterbalanced
by a sweet kindliness toward all the world&mdash;a
loveableness which made for him a friend of every
chance acquaintance.
</p>
<p>It was well along in the afternoon, and shoppers
were hurrying homeward. Orme noted the
fresh beauty of the women and girls&mdash;Chicago
has reason to be proud of her daughters&mdash;and his
heart beat a little faster. Not that he was a
man to be caught by every pretty stranger; but
scarcely recognized by himself, there was a hidden
spring of romance in his practical nature.
Heart-free, he never met a woman without wondering
whether she was <i>the</i> one. He had never
found her; he did not know that he was looking
for her; yet always there was the unconscious
question.
</p>
<p>A distant whistle, the clanging of gongs, the
rapid beat of galloping hoofs&mdash;fire-engines were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
racing down the street. Cars stopped, vehicles
of all kinds crowded in toward the curbs.
</p>
<p>Orme paused and watched the fire horses go
thundering by, their smoking chariots swaying
behind them and dropping long trails of sparks.
Small boys were running, men and women were
stopping to gaze after the passing engines, but
Orme&#8217;s attention was taken by something that
was happening near by, and as the gongs and the
hoof-beats grew fainter he looked with interest to
the street beside him.
</p>
<p>He had got as far as the corner of Madison
Street. The scramble to get out of the way of
the engines had here resulted in a traffic-jam.
Two policemen were moving about, shouting orders
for the disentanglement of the street-cars
and vehicles which seemed to be inextricably
wedged together.
</p>
<p>A burly Irish teamster was bellowing at his
horse. The hind wheel of a smart barouche was
caught in the fore wheel of a delivery wagon, and
the driver of the delivery wagon was expressing
his opinion of the situation in terms which seemed
to embarrass the elderly gentleman who sat in
the barouche. Orme&#8217;s eye traveled through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
outer edge of the disturbance, and sought its
center.
</p>
<p>There in the midst of the tangle was a big
black touring-car. Its one occupant was a girl&mdash;and
such a girl! Her fawn-colored cloak was
thrown open; her face was unveiled. Orme was
thrilled when he caught the glory of her face&mdash;the
clear skin, browned by outdoor living; the demure
but regular features; the eyes that seemed
to transmute and reflect softly all impressions
from without. Orme had never seen anyone like
her&mdash;so nobly unconscious of self, so appealing
and yet so calm.
</p>
<p>She was waiting patiently, interested in the
clamor about her, but seemingly undisturbed by
her own part in it. Orme&#8217;s eyes did not leave her
face. He was merely one of a crowd at the curb,
unnoted by her, but when after a time, he became
aware that he was staring, he felt the blood rush
to his cheeks, and he muttered: &#8220;What a boor I
am!&#8221; And then, &#8220;But who can she be? who can
she be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A policeman made his way to the black car.
Orme saw him speak to the girl; saw her brows
knit; and he quickly threaded his way into the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
street. His action was barely conscious, but nothing
could have stopped him at that moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to come to the station, miss,&#8221; the
policeman was saying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what have I done?&#8221; Her voice was
broken music.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve violated the traffic regulations, and
made all this trouble, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on a very important errand,&#8221; she began,
&#8220;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that, miss, you ought to have
had someone with you that knew the rules.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her eyes were perplexed, and she looked about
her as if for help. For a moment her gaze fell on
Orme, who was close to the policeman&#8217;s elbow.
</p>
<p>Now, Orme had a winning and disarming smile.
Without hesitation, he touched the policeman on
the shoulder, beamed pleasantly, and said:
&#8220;Pardon me, officer, but this car was forced over
by that dray.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was on the wrong side,&#8221; returned the
policeman, after a glance which modified his first
intention to take offense. &#8220;She had no business
over here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was either that or a collision. My wheel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
was scraped, as it was.&#8221; She, too, was smiling
now.
</p>
<p>The policeman pondered. He liked to be called
&#8220;officer&#8221;; he liked to be smiled upon; and the
girl, to judge from her manner and appearance,
might well be the daughter of a man of position.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said after a moment, &#8220;be more careful
another time.&#8221; He turned and went back to
his work among the other vehicles, covering the
weakness of his surrender by a fresh display of
angry authority.
</p>
<p>The girl gave a little sigh of relief and looked
at Orme. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Then he remembered that he did not know this
girl. &#8220;Can I be of further service?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I think not. But thank
you just the same.&#8221; She gave him a friendly little
nod and turned to the steering-gear.
</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to go, and Orme
returned to the curb. A moment later he saw the
black car move slowly away, and he felt as though
something sweet and fine were going out of his
life. If only there had been some way to prolong
the incident! He knew intuitively that this girl
belonged to his own class. Any insignificant acquaintance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
might introduce them to each other.
And yet convention now thrust them apart.
</p>
<p>Sometime he might meet her. Indeed, he determined
to find out who she was and make that
sometime a certainty. He would prolong his stay
in Chicago and search society until he found her.
No one had ever before sent such a thrill through
his heart. He must find her, become her friend,
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;But, again he laughed to himself,
&#8220;What a boor I am!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After all she was but a passing stranger, and
the pleasant revery into which his glimpse of her
had led him was only a revery. The memory of
her beauty and elusive charm would disappear; his
vivid impression of her would be effaced. But
even while he thought this he found himself again
wondering who she was and how he could find her.
He could not drive her from his mind.
</p>
<p>Meantime he had proceeded slowly on his way.
Suddenly a benevolent, white-bearded man halted
him, with a deprecating gesture. &#8220;Excuse me,
sir,&#8221; he began, &#8220;but your hat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme lifted his straw hat from his head. A
glance showed him that it was disfigured by a
great blotch of black grease. He had held his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
hat in his hand while talking to the girl, and it
must have touched her car at a point where the
axle of the dray had rubbed. So this was his one
memento of the incident.
</p>
<p>He thanked the stranger, and walked to a near-by
hatter&#8217;s, where a ready clerk set before him
hats of all styles. He selected one quickly and
left his soiled hat to be cleaned and sent home
later.
</p>
<p>Offering a ten-dollar bill in payment, he received
in change a five-dollar bill and a silver dollar.
He gave the coin a second glance. It was the first
silver dollar that he had handled for some time,
for he seldom visited the West.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no charge for the cleaning,&#8221; said the
clerk, noting down Orme&#8217;s name and address, and
handing the soiled hat to the cash-boy.
</p>
<p>Orme, meantime, was on the point of folding
the five-dollar bill to put it into his pocket-book.
Suddenly he looked at it intently. Written in
ink across the face of it, were the words:
</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Remember Person You Pay This To</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The writing was apparently a hurried scrawl,
but the letters were large and quite legible. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
appeared to have been written on an uneven surface,
for there were several jogs and breaks in the
writing, as if the pen had slipped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is curious,&#8221; remarked Orme.
</p>
<p>The clerk blinked his watery eyes and looked
at the bill in Orme&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Oh, yes, sir,&#8221; he
explained. &#8220;I remember that. The gentleman
who paid it in this morning called our attention
to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s the man who wrote this, he probably
doesn&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s a law against defacing
money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s perfectly good, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; inquired
the clerk. &#8220;If you want another instead&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; laughed Orme. &#8220;The banks would
take it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began the clerk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to keep it. If I can&#8217;t get rid
of it, I&#8217;ll bring it back. It&#8217;s a hoax or an endless
chain device or something of the sort. I&#8217;d like to
find out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked again at the writing. Puzzles and
problems always interested him, especially if they
seemed to involve some human story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the clerk, &#8220;I&#8217;ll remember
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
that you have it, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he peered at the name
he had set down&mdash;&#8220;Mr. Orme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leaving the hatter&#8217;s, Orme turned back on
State Street, retracing his steps. It was close
to the dinner hour, and the character of the street
crowds had changed. The shoppers had disappeared.
Suburbanites were by this time aboard
their trains and homeward bound. The street
was thronged with hurrying clerks and shop-girls,
and the cars were jammed with thousands
more, all of them thinking, no doubt, of the same
two things&mdash;something to eat and relaxation.
</p>
<p>What a hive it was, this great street! And
how scant the lives of the great majority!
Working, eating, sleeping, marrying and given
in marriage, bearing children and dying&mdash;was
that all? &#8220;But growing, too,&#8221; said Orme to
himself. &#8220;Growing, too.&#8221; Would this be the
sum of his own life&mdash;that of a worker in the hive?
It came to him with something of an inner pang
that thus far his scheme of things had included
little more. He wondered why he was now recognizing
this scantiness, this lack in his life.
</p>
<p>He came out of his revery to find himself again
at the Madison Street corner. Again he seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
to see that beautiful girl in the car, and to hear
the music of her voice.
</p>
<p>How could he best set about to find her? She
might be, like himself, a visitor in the city. But
there was the touring-car. Well, she might have
run in from one of the suburbs. He could think
of no better plan than to call that evening on the
Wallinghams and describe the unknown to Bessie
and try to get her assistance. Bessie would divine
the situation, and she would guy him unmercifully,
he knew; but he would face even that
for another glimpse of the girl of the car.
</p>
<p>And at that moment he was startled by a sharp
explosion. He looked to the street. There was
the black car, bumping along with one flat tire.
The girl threw on the brakes and came to a
stop.
</p>
<p>In an instant Orme was in the street. If he
thought that she would not remember him, her
first glance altered the assumption, for she looked
down at him with a ready smile and said:
&#8220;You see, I do need you again, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As for Orme, he could think of nothing better
to say than simply, &#8220;I am glad.&#8221; With that he
began to unfasten the spare tire.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall watch you with interest,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;I know how to run a car&mdash;though you might
not think it&mdash;but I don&#8217;t know how to repair
one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a man&#8217;s job anyway,&#8221; said Orme, busy
now with the jack, which was slowly raising the
wheel from the pavement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I get out?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Does my
weight make any difference?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Orme; but, nevertheless, she
descended to the street and stood beside him while
he worked. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there were all those
funny things inside,&#8221; she mused.
</p>
<p>Orme laughed. Her comment was vague, but
to him it was enough just to hear her voice. He
had got the wheel clear of the street and was taking
off the burst tire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We seem fated to meet,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Orme looked up at her. &#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t
think me a cad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I say that I hope
we may meet many times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her little frown warned him that she had misunderstood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you happen to know the Tom Wallinghams?&#8221;
he asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>Her smile returned. &#8220;I know <i>a</i> Tom Wallingham
and a <i>Bessie</i> Wallingham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re good friends of mine. Don&#8217;t you
think that they might introduce us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They might,&#8221; she vouchsafed, &#8220;if they happened
to see us both at the same time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme returned to his task. The crowd that
always gathers was now close about them, and
there was little opportunity for talk. He finished
his job neatly, and stowed away the old tire.
</p>
<p>She was in the car before he could offer to help
her. &#8220;Thank you again,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If only you will let me arrange it with the
Wallinghams,&#8221; he faltered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will think about it.&#8221; She smiled.
</p>
<p>He felt that she was slipping away. &#8220;Give me
some clue,&#8221; he begged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your spirit of romance?&#8221; she railed
at him; then apparently relenting: &#8220;Perhaps
the next time we meet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme groaned. With a little nod like that
which had dismissed him at the time of his first
service to her, she pulled the lever and the car
moved away.
</p>
<p>Tumult in his breast, Orme walked on. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
watched the black car thread its way down the
street and disappear around a corner. Then he
gave himself over to his own bewildering reflections,
and he was still busy with them when he
found himself at the entrance of the Père Marquette.
He had crossed the Rush Street bridge
and found his way up to the Lake Shore Drive
almost without realizing whither he was going.
</p>
<p>Orme had come to Chicago, at the request of
Eastern clients, to meet half-way the owners of a
Western mining property. When he registered
at the Annex, he found awaiting him a telegram
saying that they had been detained at Denver and
must necessarily be two days late. Besides the
telegram, there had been a letter for him&mdash;a letter
from his friend, Jack Baxter, to whom he had
written of his coming. Jack had left the city on
business, it appeared, but he urged Orme to make
free of his North Side apartment. So Orme left
the Annex and went to the rather too gorgeous,
but very luxurious Père Marquette, where he
found that the staff had been instructed to keep
a close eye on his comfort. All this had happened
but three short hours ago.
</p>
<p>After getting back to the apartment, Orme&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
first thought was to telephone to Bessie Wallingham.
He decided, however, to wait till after dinner.
He did not like to appear too eager. So he
went down to the public dining-room and ate
what was placed before him, and returned to his
apartment just at dusk.
</p>
<p>In a few moments he got Bessie Wallingham on
the wire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Robert Orme!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Wherever did you come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The usual place. Are you and Tom at home
this evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry. We&#8217;re going out with some
new friends. Wish I knew them well enough to
ask you along. Can you have some golf with us
at Arradale to-morrow afternoon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Delighted! Say, Bessie, do you know a girl
who runs a black touring-car?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know a tall, dark girl who has a black
touring-car?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know lots of tall, dark girls, and several of
them have black touring-cars. Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause and a little chuckle; then:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
&#8220;Now, Bob, that won&#8217;t do. You must tell me all
about it to-morrow. Call for us in time to catch
the one-four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was all that Orme could get out of her
and after a little banter and a brief exchange of
greetings with Tom, who was called to the telephone
by his wife, the wire was permitted to rest.
</p>
<p>Orme pushed a chair to the window of the sitting-room
and smoked lazily, looking out over the
beautiful expanse of Lake Michigan, which reflected
from its glassy surface the wonderful opalescence
of early evening. He seemed to have set
forth on a new and adventurous road. How
strangely the girl of the car had come into his
life!
</p>
<p>Then he thought of the five-dollar bill, with the
curious inscription. He took it from his pocket-book
and examined it by the fading light. The
words ran the full length of the face. Orme noticed
that the writing had a foreign look. There
were flourishes which seemed distinctly un-American.
</p>
<p>He turned the bill over. Apparently there was
no writing on the back, but as he looked more
closely he saw a dark blur in the upper left-hand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
corner. Even in the dusk he could make out that
this was not a spot of dirt; the edges were defined
too distinctly for a smudge; and it was not black
enough for an ink-blot.
</p>
<p>Moving to the center-table, he switched on the
electric lamp, and looked at the blur again. It
stood out plainly now, a series of letters and
numbers:
</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Evans, S. R. Chi. A. 100 N. 210 E. T.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The first thought that came to Orme was that
this could be no hoax. A joker would have made
the curious cryptogram more conspicuous. But
what did it mean? Was it a secret formula?
Did it give the location of a buried treasure?
And why in the name of common sense had it been
written on a five-dollar bill?
</p>
<p>More likely, Orme reasoned, it concealed information
for or about some person&mdash;&#8220;S. R.
Evans,&#8221; probably. And who was this S. R.
Evans?
</p>
<p>The better to study the mystery, Orme copied
the inscription on a sheet of note-paper, which he
found in the table drawer. From the first he decided
that there was no cipher. The letters undoubtedly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
were abbreviations. &#8220;Evans&#8221; must
be, as he had already determined, a man&#8217;s name.
&#8220;Chi&#8221; might be, probably was, &#8220;Chicago.&#8221;
&#8220;100 N. 210 E.&#8221; looked like &#8220;100 (feet?
paces?) north, 210 (feet? paces?) east.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The &#8220;A.&#8221; and the &#8220;T.&#8221; bothered him. &#8220;A.&#8221;
might be the place to which &#8220;S. R. Evans&#8221; was
directed, or at which he was to be found&mdash;a place
sufficiently indicated by the letter. Now as to
the &#8220;T.&#8221;&mdash;was it &#8220;treasure&#8221;? Or was it
&#8220;time&#8221;? Or &#8220;true&#8221;? Orme had no way of
telling. It might even be the initial of the person
who had penned the instructions.
</p>
<p>Without knowing where &#8220;A.&#8221; was, Orme could
make nothing of the cryptogram. For that
matter, he realized that unless the secret were
criminal it was not his affair. But he knew that
legitimate business information is seldom transmitted
by such mysterious means.
</p>
<p>Again and again he went over the abbreviations,
but the more closely he studied them, the more
baffling he found them. The real meaning appeared
to hinge on the &#8220;A.&#8221; and the &#8220;T.&#8221; Eventually
he was driven to the conclusion that those
two letters could not be understood by anyone
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
who was not already partly in the secret, if secret
it was. It occurred to him to have the city
directory sent up to him. He might then find the
address of &#8220;S. R. Evans,&#8221; if that person happened
to be a Chicagoan. But it was quite likely that
the &#8220;Chi.&#8221; might mean something other than that
&#8220;Evans&#8221; lived in Chicago. Perhaps, in the morning
he would satisfy his curiosity about &#8220;S. R.
Evans,&#8221; but for the present he lacked the inclination
to press the matter that far.
</p>
<p>In the midst of his puzzling, the telephone-bell
rang. He crossed the room and put the receiver
to his ear. &#8220;Yes?&#8221; he questioned.
</p>
<p>The clerk&#8217;s voice answered. &#8220;Senhor Poritol
to see Mr. Orme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;S-e-n-h-o-r&mdash;P-o-r-i-t-o-l,&#8221; spelled the clerk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know him,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;There must
be some mistake. Are you sure that he asked
for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause. Orme heard a few scattered
words which indicated that the clerk was
questioning the stranger. Then came the information:
&#8220;He says he wishes to see you about
a five-dollar bill.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Orme realized that he had no reason to
be surprised. &#8220;Well, send him up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver and, returning to the
table, put the marked bill back into his pocket-book
and slipped into a drawer the paper on which
he had copied the inscription.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SENHOR PORITOL</h3>
</div>

<p>When Orme answered the knock at the door a
singular young man stood at the threshold. He
was short, wiry, and very dark. His nose was
long and complacently tilted at the end. His
eyes were small and very black. His mouth was
a wide, uncertain slit. In his hand he carried a
light cane and a silk hat of the flat-brimmed
French type. And he wore a gray sack suit,
pressed and creased with painful exactness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Senhor Poritol,&#8221; said Orme, motioning
toward a chair.
</p>
<p>The little man entered, with short, rapid steps.
He drew from his pocket a clean pocket-handkerchief,
which he unfolded and spread out on the
surface of the table. Upon the handkerchief he
carefully placed his hat and then, after an ineffectual
effort to make it stand against the table
edge, laid his cane on the floor.
</p>
<p>Not until all this ceremony had been completed
did he appear to notice Orme. But now he turned,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
widening his face into a smile and extending
his hand, which Orme took rather dubiously&mdash;it
was supple and moist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this is Mr. Orme, is it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Orme, freeing himself from the unpleasant
handshake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. <i>Robert</i> Orme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is my name. What can I do for
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment Senhor Poritol appeared to
hover like a timid bird; then he seated himself on
the edge of a chair, only the tips of his toes
touching the floor. His eyes danced brightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To begin with, Mr. Orme,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am
charmed to meet you&mdash;very charmed.&#8221; He rolled
his &#8220;r&#8217;s&#8221; after a fashion that need not be reproduced.
&#8220;And in the second place,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;while actually I am a foreigner in your dear
country, I regard myself as in spirit one of your
natives. I came here when a boy, and was educated
at your great University of Princeton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a Portuguese&mdash;I infer from your
name,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, no! Oh, no, no, no!&#8221; exclaimed
Senhor Poritol, tapping the floor nervously with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
his toes. &#8220;My country he freed himself from the
Portuguese yoke many and many a year ago. I
am a South American, Mr. Orme&mdash;one of the
poor relations of your great country.&#8221; Again
the widened smile. Then he suddenly became
grave, and leaned forward, his hands on his knees.
&#8220;But this is not the business of our meeting, Mr.
Orme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; inquired Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my dear sir. I have come to ask of you
about the five-dollar bill which you received in the
hat-shop this afternoon.&#8221; He peered anxiously.
&#8220;You still have it? You have not spent it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A marked bill, was it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. Where is it, my dear sir, where
is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Written across the face of it were the words,
&#8216;Remember person you pay this to.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And on the back of it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the back of it!&#8221; gasped the little man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was a curious cryptogram.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not torture me!&#8221; exclaimed Senhor Poritol.
&#8220;Have you got it?&#8221; His fingers worked
nervously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Orme slowly, &#8220;I still have it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol hastily took a fresh five-dollar
bill from his pocket. &#8220;See,&#8221; he said, jumping
to the floor, &#8220;here is another just as good a bill.
I give this to you in return for the bill which was
paid to you this afternoon.&#8221; He thrust the new
bill toward Orme, and waved his other hand rhetorically.
&#8220;That, and that alone, is my business
with you, dear sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme&#8217;s hand went to his pocket. The visitor
watched the motion eagerly, and a grimace of disappointment
contracted his features when the
hand came forth, holding a cigar-case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have one,&#8221; Orme urged.
</p>
<p>In his anxiety the little man almost danced.
&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; he broke forth, &#8220;I am in desperate
hurry. I must meet a friend. I must catch a
train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; interrupted Orme. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
very well give up that bill until I know a little better
what it means. You will have to show me
that you are entitled to it&mdash;and&#8221;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&#8220;meantime
you&#8217;d better smoke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol sighed. &#8220;I can assure you of
my honesty of purpose, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
tell you about it. I have not the time. Also, it
is not my secret. This bill, sir, is just as good
as the other one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; said Orme dryly. He was wondering
whether this was some new counterfeiting
dodge. How easily most persons could be induced
to make the transfer!
</p>
<p>A counterfeiter, however, would hardly work by
so picturesque and noticeable a method, unless he
were carefully disguised&mdash;hardly even then. Was
Senhor Poritol disguised? Orme looked at him
more closely. No, he could see where the roots
of the coarse black hair joined the scalp. And
there was not the least evidence of make-up on the
face. Nevertheless, Orme did not feel warranted
in giving up the marked bill without a definite explanation.
The little man was a comic figure,
but his bizarre exterior might conceal a dangerous
plot. He might be a thief, an anarchist, anything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, my dear sir, please do not add to my
already very great anxiety,&#8221; pleaded the visitor.
</p>
<p>Orme spoke more decisively. &#8220;You are a
stranger, Senhor Poritol. I don&#8217;t know what all
this mystery conceals, but I can&#8217;t give you that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
bill unless I know more about it&mdash;and I won&#8217;t,&#8221;
he added, as he saw Senhor Poritol open his
mouth for further pleading.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; sighed the little man. He hesitated
for an instant, then added: &#8220;I do not
blame you for insisting, and I suppose I must say
to you everything that you demand. No, I do
not smoke the cigar, please. But if you do not
object&mdash;&#8221; He produced a square of cigarette
paper and some tobacco from a silver-mounted
pouch, and deftly rolled a cigarette with one hand,
accepting a match from Orme with the other.
Closing his eyes, he inhaled the smoke deeply,
breathing it out through his nostrils.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated, his eyes roving about
the room as if in search of something&mdash;&#8220;Well, I
will explain to you why I want the bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme lighted a fresh cigar, and settled himself
to hear the story. Senhor Poritol drew a second
handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his
damp brow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must know, my very dear sir,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;that I come from a country which is very rich
in the resources of nature. In the unsettled interior
are very great mineral deposits which are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
little known, and since the day when the great
Vega made the first exploration there has been
the belief that the Urinaba Mountains hide a
great wealth in gold. Many men for three hundred
years have risked their most precious lives
to go look for it. But they have not found it.
No, my dear sir, they have not found it until&mdash;But
have patience, and you shall hear everything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A few days ago a countryman of mine sent
word that he was about to die. He asked that I,
his early friend, should come to him immediately
and receive news of utmost importance. He was
lying sick in the hotel of a small city in Wisconsin.
He was a tobacco agent and he had been attacked
by Death while he was on a business trip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Filled with the heartbroken hope to see him
once more before he died, I went even as I was, to
a train and made all haste to his bedside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was his name?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lopez,&#8221; replied Senhor Poritol promptly;
and Orme knew that the answer might as well have
been Smith. But the little man returned quickly
to his story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend had no strength left. He was, oh,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
so weak that I wept to see him. But he sent the
doctor and the priest out of the room, and then&mdash;and
then he whispered in my ear a secret. He
had discovered rich gold in the Urinaba country.
He had been trying to earn money to go back and
dig up the gold. But, alas! now he was dying,
and he wished to give the secret to me, his old
friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tears streamed on my cheek.&#8221; Senhor Poritol&#8217;s
eyes filled, seemingly at the remembrance.
&#8220;But I took out my fountain-pen to write down
the directions he wished to give. See&mdash;this was
the pen.&#8221; He produced a gold-mounted tube
from his waistcoat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I searched my pockets for a piece of paper.
None could I discover. There was no time to be
lost, for my friend was growing weaker, oh, very
fast. In desperation I took a five-dollar bill,
and wrote upon it the directions he gave me for
finding the gold. Even as I finished it, dear
Lopez breathed his last breath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme puffed at his cigar. &#8220;So the bill carries
directions for finding a rich deposit in the Urinaba
Mountains?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear sir. But you would not rob
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
me of it. You could not understand the directions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#8221; Orme laughed. &#8220;I have no interest
in South American gold mines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then accept this fresh bill,&#8221; implored Senhor
Poritol, &#8220;and give me back the one I yearn for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme hesitated. &#8220;A moment more,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Tell me, how did you lose possession of the
marked bill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The South American writhed in his chair and
leaned forward eagerly. &#8220;That is the most distressing
part of all,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I had left
Chicago at a time when my presence in this great
city was very important indeed. Nothing but
the call from a dying friend would have induced
me to go away. My whole future in this country
depended upon my returning in time to complete
certain business.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, after dear Lopez was dead, I rushed to
the local railroad station. A train was coming in.
I searched my pocket for my money to buy my
ticket. All I could find was the five-dollar bill!
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was necessary to return to Chicago; yet I
could not lose the bill. A happy thought struck
me. I wrote upon the face of it the words you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
have seen, and paid it to the ticket-agent. I
called his attention to the writing and implored
him to save the bill if he could until I returned,
and if not, to be sure to remember the person he
gave it to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem funny,&#8221; said Senhor Poritol,
rolling another cigarette, &#8220;but you cannot
imagine my most frantic desperation. I returned
to Chicago and transacted my business. Then
I hastened back to the Wisconsin city. Woe is
me! The ticket-agent had paid the bill to a
Chicago citizen. I secured the name of this man
and finally found him at his office on La Salle
Street. Alas! he, too, had spent the bill, but I
tracked it from person to person, until now, my
dear sir, I have found it? So&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused
and looked eloquently at Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know a man named Evans?&#8221; Orme
asked.
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol looked at him in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;S. R. Evans,&#8221; insisted Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, dear sir&mdash;I think not&mdash;But what
has that to do&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme pushed a sheet of paper across the table.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
&#8220;Oblige me, Senhor Poritol. Print in small capitals
the name, &#8216;S. R. Evans.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol was apparently reluctant.
However, under the compulsion of Orme&#8217;s eye, he
finally took out his fountain-pen and wrote the
name in flowing script. He then pushed the paper
back toward Orme, with an inquiring look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that isn&#8217;t what I mean,&#8221; exclaimed Orme.
&#8220;Print it. Print it in capital letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol slowly printed out the name.
</p>
<p>Orme took the paper, laying it before him.
He then produced the coveted bill from his pocket-book.
Senhor Poritol uttered a little cry of delight
and stretched forth an eager hand, but
Orme, who was busily comparing the letters on
the paper with the letters on the bill, waved him
back.
</p>
<p>After a few moments Orme looked up. &#8220;Senhor
Poritol,&#8221; he said, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you write the
secret on a time-table, or on your ticket, before
you gave the bill to the agent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol was flustered. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he said
uncertainly, &#8220;I did not think of that. How can
we explain the mistakes we make in moments of
great nervousness?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;But one more point.
You did not yourself write your friend&#8217;s secret on
the bill. The letters which you have just printed
are differently made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol said nothing. He was breathing
hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand,&#8221; continued Orme, turning
the bill over and eyeing the inscription on its face,
&#8220;your mistake in first writing the name instead
of printing it, shows me that you did write the
words on the <i>face</i> of the bill.&#8221; He returned the
bill to his pocket-book. &#8220;I can&#8217;t give you the
bill,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your story doesn&#8217;t hold together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a queer little scream, the South American
bounded from his chair and flung himself at
Orme. He struck no blow, but clawed desperately
at Orme&#8217;s pocket. The struggle lasted only
for a moment. Orme, seizing the little man by the
collar, dragged him, wriggling, to the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now get out,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;If I find you
hanging around, I&#8217;ll have you locked up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol whispered: &#8220;It is my secret.
Why should I tell you the truth about it? You
have no right to know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>Orme retained his hold. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like your
looks, my friend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There may have
been reason why you should lie to me, but you will
have to make things clear.&#8221; He considered. After
all, he must make allowance; so he said:
&#8220;Come back to-morrow with evidence that you
are entitled to the bill, and you shall have it.&#8221; He
released Senhor Poritol.
</p>
<p>The little man had recovered his composure.
He went back to the table and took up his hat
and cane, refolding the handkerchief and slipping
it into his pocket. Once more he was the Latin
fop. He approached Orme, and his manner was
deprecatory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My most abject apologies for attacking you,
sir. I was beside myself. But if you will only
permit me, I will bring up my friend, who is waiting
below. He will, as you say, vouch for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very, very distinguished man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme pondered. The adventure was opening
up, and he felt inclined to see it through.
&#8220;Bring him,&#8221; he said shortly.
</p>
<p>When Senhor Poritol had disappeared Orme
telephoned to the clerk. &#8220;Send me up a porter,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
he ordered, &#8220;and have him stand just outside my
door, with orders to enter if he hears any disturbance.&#8221;
He waited at the door till the porter
appeared, then told him to remain in a certain
place until he was needed, or until the visitors left.
</p>
<p>Senhor Poritol remained downstairs for several
minutes. Evidently he was explaining the
situation to his friend. But after a time Orme
heard the clang of the elevator door, and in response
to the knock that quickly followed, he
opened his own door. At the side of his former
visitor stood a dapper foreigner. He wore a
long frock coat and carried a glossy hat, and his
eyes were framed by large gold spectacles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Senhor Alcatrante,&#8221; explained
Senhor Poritol.
</p>
<p>The newcomer bowed with suave dignity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Senhor Alcatrante? The name is familiar,&#8221;
said Orme, smiling.
</p>
<p>Poritol assumed an air. &#8220;He is the minister
from my country to these United States.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme understood. This was the wary South
American diplomat whose name had lately been
so prominent in the Washington dispatches.
What was he doing in Chicago?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to meet you,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante smiled, displaying a prominent row
of uneven teeth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My young friend, Poritol,&#8221; he began, &#8220;tells
me that you have in your possession the record of
a secret belonging to him. What that secret is,
is immaterial to you and me, I take it. He is an
honorable young man&mdash;excitable, perhaps, but
well-meaning. I would suggest that you give
him the five-dollar bill he desires, accepting from
him another in exchange. Or, if you still doubt
him, permit me to offer you a bill from my own
pocket.&#8221; He drew out a fat wallet.
</p>
<p>The situation appeared to be simplified. And
yet Orme was dubious. There was mischief in
the bill; so much he felt sure of. Alcatrante&#8217;s reputation
was that of a fox, and as for Poritol, he
was, to say the least, a person of uncertain qualities.
Orme could not but admire the subtle manner
in which Alcatrante sought delicately to limit
his doubts to the mere possibility that Poritol was
trying to pass spurious money. He decided not
to settle the question at this moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This seems to be rather a mixed-up affair,
Senhor Alcatrante,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
more in it than appears. Call on me to-morrow
morning, and you shall have my decision.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante and Poritol looked at each other.
The minister spoke:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you engage not to give the bill to anyone
else in the interval?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will promise that,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;It is only
fair. Yes, I will keep the bill until to-morrow
morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One other suggestion,&#8221; continued Alcatrante.
&#8220;You may not be willing to give up the bill, but
is there any reason why you should refuse to let
Senhor Poritol copy the writing that is on it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only my determination to think the whole
matter over before I do anything at all,&#8221; Orme
replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the bill came into your hands by chance,&#8221;
insisted the minister. &#8220;The information means
nothing to you, though obviously it means a great
deal to my young friend, here. May I ask what
right you have to deny this request?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What right?&#8221; Orme&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;My
right is that I have the bill and the information,
and I intend to understand the situation better before
I give the information to anyone else.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you recognized Senhor Poritol&#8217;s handwriting
on the bill,&#8221; exclaimed the minister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the face of it, yes. He did not write the
abbreviations on the back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Abbreviations!&#8221; exclaimed Poritol.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please let the matter rest till morning,&#8221; said
Orme stubbornly. &#8220;I have told you just what I
would do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poritol opened his mouth, to speak, but Alcatrante
silenced him with a frown. &#8220;Your
word is sufficient, Mr. Orme,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will
call to-morrow morning. Is ten o&#8217;clock too
early?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;Doubtless I shall
be able to satisfy you. I merely wish to think
it over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a formal bow, Alcatrante turned to the
door and departed, Poritol following.
</p>
<p>Orme strolled back to his window and stood
idly watching the lights of the vessels on the lake.
But his mind was not on the unfolded view before
him. He was puzzling over this mystery in which
he had so suddenly become a factor. Unquestionably,
the five-dollar bill held the key to some
serious problem.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>Surely Alcatrante had not come merely as the
friend of Poritol, for the difference in the station
of the two South Americans was marked. Poritol
was a cheap character&mdash;useful, no doubt, in
certain kinds of work, but vulgar and unconvincing.
He might well be one of those promoters
who hang on at the edge of great projects, hoping
to pick up a commission here and there. His
strongest point was his obvious effort to triumph
over his own insignificance, for this effort, by its
comic but desperate earnestness, could not but
command a certain degree of respect.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante, on the other hand, was a name to
make statesmen knit their brows. A smooth
trouble-maker, he had set Europe by the ears in
the matter of unsettled South American loans,
dexterously appealing to the much-overworked
Monroe Doctrine every time his country was
threatened by a French or German or British
blockade. But his mind was of no small caliber.
He could hold his own not only at his own game
of international chess, but in the cultured discussion
of polite topics. Orme knew of him as a
clever after-dinner speaker, a man who could,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
when he so desired, please greatly by his personal
charm.
</p>
<p>No, Alcatrante was no friend of Poritol&#8217;s; nor
was it likely that, as protector of the interests of
his countrymen, he would go so far as to accompany
them on their errands unless much was at
stake. Perhaps Poritol was Alcatrante&#8217;s tool
and had bungled some important commission. It
occurred to Orme that the secret of the bill might
be connected with the negotiation of a big business
concession in Alcatrante&#8217;s country. &#8220;S. R.
Evans&#8221; might be trying to get control of rubber
forests or mines&mdash;in the Urinaba Mountains, perhaps,
after all.
</p>
<p>In any event, he felt positive that the secret of
the bill did not rightfully belong to Poritol. If
the bill had been in his possession, he should have
been able to copy the abbreviated message. Indeed,
the lies that he had told were all against the notion
of placing any confidence in him. The two South
Americans were altogether too eager.
</p>
<p>Orme decided to go for a walk. He could
think better in the open air. He took up his hat
and cane, and descended in the elevator.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>In the office the clerk stopped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man called to see you a few minutes ago,
Mr. Orme. When I told him that you were engaged
with two visitors he went away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he leave his name?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. He was a Japanese.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme nodded and went on out to the street.
What could a Japanese want of him?
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE SHADOWS</h3>
</div>

<p>Orme walked north along the Lake Shore
Drive. As best he could, he pieced together the
curious adventures of the day. The mystery of
the five-dollar bill and the extreme anxiety of
Poritol seemed to be complicated by the appearance
of the Japanese at the Père Marquette.
Orme sought the simplest explanation. He knew
that mysterious happenings frequently become
clear when one definitely tries to fit them into the
natural routine of every-day life. The Japanese,
he mused, was probably some valet out of a job.
But how could he have learned Orme&#8217;s name. Possibly
he had not known it; the clerk might have
given it to him. The incident hardly seemed
worth second thought, but he found himself persistently
turning to one surmise after another
concerning the Japanese. For Orme was convinced
that he stood on the edge of a significant
situation.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he took notice of a figure a short
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
distance ahead of him. This man&mdash;apparently
very short and stocky&mdash;was also going northward,
but he was moving along in an erratic manner.
At one moment he would hurry his steps, at
the next he would almost stop. Evidently he was
regulating his pace with a purpose.
</p>
<p>Orme let his eyes travel still farther ahead. He
observed two men actively conversing. From
time to time their discussion became so animated
that they halted for a moment and faced each
other, gesticulating rapidly. Every time they
halted, the single figure nearer to Orme slowed
down his own pace.
</p>
<p>The oblivious couple came under a street lamp
and again turned toward each other. Their profiles
were distinct. Orme had already suspected
their identity, for both had high hats and carried
canes, and one of them was in a sack suit, while
the other wore a frock coat. And now the profiles
verified the surmise. There was no mistaking
the long, tip-tilted nose of the shorter man and
the glinting spectacles of the other. The two
were Poritol and Alcatrante.
</p>
<p>But who was the man trailing them? A
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
friendly guard? Or a menacing enemy? Orme
decided to shadow the shadow.
</p>
<p>At a corner not far from the entrance to Lincoln
Park, Poritol and Alcatrante became so
apparently excited that they stood, chattering volubly
for several minutes. The shadow stopped altogether.
He folded his arms and looked out
over the lake like any casual wanderer, but now
and then he turned his head toward the others.
He seemed to be indifferent to what they were
saying, though he was near enough to them to
catch fragments of their conversation, if he so
desired. The South Americans were probably
talking in that dialect of Portuguese which their
nation has developed.
</p>
<p>Meantime Orme also stopped, taking up a position
like that of the shadow. He saw Poritol,
with outstretched, questioning hands, his eyes
fixed on the face of Alcatrante, who seemed to be
delivering orders. The flashing reflections of
light from the minister&#8217;s spectacles indicated his
authoritative nods of the head.
</p>
<p>After a time Alcatrante evidently completed his
instructions. He removed his hat and bowed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
formally. Little Poritol echoed the salute and,
turning, shot off down a side street, with ridiculously
rapid movements of his short legs. Orme
inferred that he was bound for the North Clark
Street car line. Alcatrante continued along the
drive.
</p>
<p>When the South Americans separated, the
shadow quickly came to life. He hesitated for an
instant, as if in doubt which of the two to follow,
then decided in favor of Alcatrante, who was
moving in leisurely fashion toward the park entrance,
his head bowed in thought. Orme found
himself wondering what snaky plots were winding
through that dark mind.
</p>
<p>The procession of three silently entered the
park. The shadow was about a hundred feet behind
Alcatrante. Orme kept the same distance
between himself and the shadow.
</p>
<p>The minister was in no hurry. Indifferent
to his surroundings he made his way, with no apparent
interest in the paths he took. At last he
turned into a dark stretch and for the moment
was lost to sight in the night.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the shadow darted forward. Orme
hurried his own pace, and in a moment he heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
the sounds of a short, sharp struggle&mdash;a scuffling
of feet in the gravel, a heavy fall. There was no
outcry.
</p>
<p>Orme broke into a run. At a point where the
path was darkest he checked himself for an instant.
A little distance ahead a man lay flat on
the ground, and bending over him was a short,
stocky figure.
</p>
<p>Orme leaped forward and swung his cane.
The stick was tough and the blow was hard
enough to send a man to earth, but the robber
had heard Orme&#8217;s approach, and looked up from
his victim just in time. With a motion indescribably
swift, he caught with one hand the descending
cane and wrenched it from Orme&#8217;s grasp.
Then he crouched to spring.
</p>
<p>At this instant Orme heard footsteps behind
him. A turn of the head showed a threatening
figure at his back. There had been four men in
that procession through the park!
</p>
<p>By a quick leap to one side, Orme placed himself
for the moment out of danger. His two
assailants, moving too fast to stop, bumped together.
They faced about for another spring at
him. And then there was a short scratching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
sound, and in the hand of the man on the ground
flared a match.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; exclaimed the prostrate Alcatrante, &#8220;I
thought so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme found himself looking into the contorted
faces of two Japanese.
</p>
<p>Discovery was evidently the last thing the hold-up
men desired, for they disappeared like a flash,
diving through the shrubbery behind them.
Orme, dazed and breathing hard, attempted no
immediate pursuit. He stepped quickly to Alcatrante
and helped him to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not hurt,&#8221; said the South American.
&#8220;When the man threw me to the ground, I feigned
that I was stunned. It is wiser not to resist
a thug, is it not so?&#8221; He brushed the dust from
his clothing with his handkerchief. Orme handed
him his hat, which had rolled to one side. The
minister rubbed it carefully with his coat-sleeve.
&#8220;See,&#8221; he laughed, nodding at the ground, &#8220;my
cane is broken. I must have fallen on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you&#8217;re not hurt,&#8221; said Orme, &#8220;we&#8217;d
better get after the thieves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; replied Alcatrante. &#8220;What is the
use? They are already far away&mdash;and they got
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
nothing.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;Is it not always better
to avoid notoriety, Mr. Orme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule, no doubt&mdash;but in this instance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Alcatrante firmly, &#8220;I really must
insist that we let the matter drop. As for me, I
shall return to my hotel. Perhaps you will walk
along with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme hesitated. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like those thieves to
get off without a chase, <i>senhor</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear Mr. Orme, they did me no
harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;You forget
that there was one after me as well as one after
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t forget that. But don&#8217;t you see,
Mr. Orme? Those two men were not after our
valuables.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. What they would like is my little
friend Poritol&#8217;s secret.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why Japanese?&#8221; Orme was puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, indeed? A cunning Japanese might
as easily have got wind of it as anyone else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why did you say, &#8216;I thought so&#8217;?&#8221; persisted
Orme.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say that? It must have been because
I suspected that only a Japanese could be so agile
as my assailant. But all this is immaterial. I
should have warned you that Poritol&#8217;s secret is
dangerous. You should not have left your
apartments.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this certainly is a queer kettle of fish,&#8221;
muttered Orme. He was beginning to feel disgusted
with the situation. He did not like Alcatrante&#8217;s
oily smoothness, and he wondered
whether it would not have been better to hand the
bill over to Poritol at the first demand. But it
came to his mind that in a certain degree he stood
committed to continue the policy he had adopted.
He had sought adventure; it was coming to him
in full measure.
</p>
<p>Together they walked back toward the park
entrance. The minister seemingly exerted himself
to regain the ground he had lost with Orme.
He proved an interesting conversationalist&mdash;keen,
slightly cynical, but not without an under-note
of earnestness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen me much abused by your press,
Mr. Orme,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is natural. I have
the interests of my own country to protect, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
those interests are of necessity sometimes opposed
to the interests of other countries. But if your
people would be even more patient with us&mdash;all
we need is time. There is reason for our persistent
to-morrow; for we are young, and it is a
slow process to realize on our resources. That is
why we do not pay our debts more promptly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme said nothing, but he thought of looted
South American treasuries, of exiled presidents
squandering their official stealings at Paris and
Monte Carlo, of concessions sold and sold again
to rival foreign companies.
</p>
<p>They had now reached the park entrance.
&#8220;There is a cab,&#8221; said Alcatrante. &#8220;You will
ride with me as far as your hotel?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, no,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;I rather need
the walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante smiled persuasively. &#8220;Permit me
to urge you. If you should be robbed, my little
friend might lose his precious secret. Poor
boy!&#8221; he added. &#8220;His father was my friend,
and I cannot refuse him a service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cab had swung around to the curb beside
them. Orme had no fear of robbery on the
lighted drive, but since Alcatrante was so insistent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
he felt inclined to yield. He might as well
ride; so he permitted the minister to bow him into
the cab, and presently they were whirling along
southward. There was a period of silence.
Then Alcatrante spoke meditatively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see how it happened, I suppose,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Those Japanese were waiting outside your hotel.
When Poritol and I came out, one of them followed
us, while the other remained on guard. Then you
started on your stroll, and the man who remained
on guard set out after you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Orme, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see how the
fellow could have known who I was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante laughed. &#8220;Oh, he could have
placed you in a number of different ways. He may
have got your description from one of the servants&mdash;or
from the clerk. But it is enough that
he did know you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Orme, &#8220;this is beyond me. That
five-dollar bill seems to be very much desired by
different groups of persons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante nodded. &#8220;I am not sure,&#8221; he said
slowly, &#8220;but that it would ease young Poritol&#8217;s
mind if you would place the bill in my hands for
safekeeping. Not that he mistrusts you, Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
Orme, but he imagines that you may not realize
how important it is to him, and you might not
guard it carefully.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agreed to keep it until to-morrow,&#8221; said
Orme, quietly. &#8220;As for thieves, my apartment
is on the tenth floor, pretty well out of their
reach. The only danger of robbery lies between
the cab and the hotel office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; chuckled Alcatrante. &#8220;It is,
of course, as you will. I was merely thinking of
my young friend&#8217;s peace of mind. I am his fellow-countryman,
you see, and his confidence in
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he stopped, with another chuckle. &#8220;Singular,
is it not, how impressionable are the
young?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme said nothing. He did not enjoy this
fencing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the lake,&#8221; Alcatrante suddenly exclaimed.
&#8220;How beautiful an expanse of water.
It has so much more color than the sea. But you
should see our wonderful harbor of Rio, Mr.
Orme. Perhaps some day I shall be permitted to
show you its magnificences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;It would be very
pleasant.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As to the bill,&#8221; continued Alcatrante quickly,
&#8220;do you care to give it to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme felt himself frowning. &#8220;I will keep it till
the morning,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it is of no consequence.&#8221; Alcatrante
laughed shortly. &#8220;See, here is your hotel. Your
company has been a pleasure to me, Mr. Orme.
You arrived most opportunely in the park.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme jumped to the curb and, turning, shook
the hand that was extended to him. &#8220;Thank you
for the lift, Senhor Alcatrante,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shall
look for you in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning&mdash;yes. And pray, my dear sir,
do not wander in the streets any more this evening.
Our experience in the park has made me
apprehensive.&#8221; The minister lifted his hat, and
the cab rattled away.
</p>
<p>The entrance to the Père Marquette was a massive
gateway, which opened upon a wide tunnel,
leading to an interior court. On the farther side
of the court were the doors of the hotel lobby.
As a rule, carriages drove through the tunnel into
the court, but Orme had not waited for this formality.
</p>
<p>He started through the tunnel. There was no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
one in sight. He noted the elaborate terra-cotta
decorations of the walls, and marveled at the bad
taste which had lost sight of this opportunity for
artistic simplicity. But through the opening before
him he could see the fountain playing in the
center of the court. The central figure of the
group, a naiad, beckoned with a hand from which
the water fell in a shower. The effect was not
so unpleasing. If one wished to be rococo, why not
be altogether so? Like the South Americans?
Was their elaborate ornamentation plastered on
to an inner steel construction? Orme wondered.
</p>
<p>Midway of the tunnel, and at the right as one
entered, was a door leading into the porter&#8217;s office.
This door was shut, but as Orme approached
it, it noiselessly opened out. He expected to see
a porter appear, and when no person stepped over
the sill, he inferred that the door had been blown
open by an interior draught.
</p>
<p>Just as he was turning out to go around the
the door&mdash;which shut off all view of him from the
inner court&mdash;a figure shot through the opening.
</p>
<p>Before Orme could dodge, he was seized firmly
by the shoulders and jerked into the room, with
a force that sent him staggering. He tripped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
over a chair and went to the floor, but quickly
scrambled to his feet and wheeled about.
</p>
<p>Two men stood between him and the door, which
had been closed silently and swiftly. They were
short and stockily built. Orme exclaimed aloud,
for the light that filtered through a window from
the street showed two faces unmistakably oriental.
</p>
<p>If this was an ordinary robbery, the daring
of the robbers was almost incredible. They ran
the risk that the porter would return&mdash;if they
had not already made away with him. Only the
most desperate purpose could explain their action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; demanded Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your pocket-book,&#8221; replied one of the men&mdash;&#8220;queek!&#8221;
He smiled an elusive smile as he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I refuse?&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we take. Be queek.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A call for help would hardly bring anyone; but
Orme gave a loud cry, more to disconcert his
enemies than with any hope of rescue.
</p>
<p>At the same instant he rushed toward the door,
and struck out at the nearer Japanese.
</p>
<p>The blow did not land. His wrist was caught
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
in a grip like an iron clamp, and he found himself
performing queer gyrations. The Japanese
had turned his back toward Orme and swung the
imprisoned arm over his shoulder. A quick lurch
forward, and Orme sailed through the air, coming
down heavily on his side. His arm was still held,
and in a few seconds he was on his back, his assailant
astride him and smiling down into his face.
</p>
<p>Orme struggled to free himself, and promptly
felt a breaking strain on his imprisoned arm. The
knee of the Japanese was under the back of Orme&#8217;s
elbow. A moderate use of the leverage thus obtained
would snap the arm like a pipe-stem. This
Orme realized, as he ceased struggling. The strain
on his arm relaxed slightly, but the grip was maintained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jiu-jitsu,&#8221; explained the Japanese in a tone
that sounded gently apologetic.
</p>
<p>The other robber now stooped and ran his hands
over Orme&#8217;s coat. Finding the pocket-book, he
took it from its inside pocket and went swiftly to a
table. He produced from his own pocket a little
electric hand-lamp, by the light of which he took
rapid count of Orme&#8217;s money.
</p>
<p>His eyes glittered; a wide scar on his forehead
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
stood out whitely. Suddenly he gave a little cry
and held up a single bill. He jabbered excitedly to
his companion for a moment, then spoke quietly
to Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This all we want,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are not
thief, see&mdash;I put other five-dollar bill in its place
and leave pocket-book here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thrust the selected bill into his pocket, put
the fresh bill in the pocket-book, and laid the
pocket-book on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; said Orme, still prone, &#8220;what&#8217;s
the meaning of all this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say.&#8221; The Japanese smiled. He went
over to the door. &#8220;Come,&#8221; he said. The man
astride Orme released his hold and sprang to his
feet. Like a flash, both the Japanese disappeared.
</p>
<p>Orme jumped up. Seizing his pocket-book and
his hat, he darted after his assailants. At the
street entrance to the tunnel, he looked quickly in
both directions, but his men were not in sight.
</p>
<p>Pursuit was futile. Slowly he turned back. He
thought of notifying the police, but, after all, he
was none the worse off&mdash;except for his promise to
Poritol and Alcatrante, now involuntarily broken.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
He must explain to them as best he could. The
marked bill had been of no consequence to him
except as a focus of adventure. And he had had
about as much adventure as he could expect for
one evening.
</p>
<p>But the secret of the bill still tantalized him.
Blindfolded, he had played in a game at which
the others saw. It seemed unfair&mdash;as if he had
some right to know the meaning of all these mysterious
incidents. Why had Poritol wanted the
bill so badly? Why had the desire to possess it
driven the two Japanese to such extreme measures?
</p>
<p>Orme crossed the court and entered the lobby.
The clerk looked at him curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Orme,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is a young lady
in the reception-room, waiting to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; Orme looked his surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. She gave no name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she been waiting long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without further questioning, Orme turned to
the door of the little green-and-gold room. At the
threshold he paused in bewilderment. Arising to
meet him, smiling frankly, was the girl of the
car.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE GIRL OF THE CAR</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, with a little gasp of recognition,
&#8220;are <i>you</i> Mr. Orme?&#8221; Her cheeks flushed softly.
</p>
<p>He bowed; his heart was beating furiously, and
for the moment he dared not try to speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we do meet again,&#8221; she exclaimed&mdash;&#8220;and
as usual I need your help. Isn&#8217;t it queer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any service that I&#8221;&mdash;Orme began haltingly&mdash;&#8220;of
course, anything that I can do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl laughed&mdash;a merry ripple of sound; then
caught herself and changed her manner to grave
earnestness. &#8220;It is very important,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I am looking for a five-dollar bill that was paid
to you to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme started. &#8220;What? You, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, too? Has&mdash;has anybody else&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; Her
gravity was more intense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said Orme&mdash;&#8220;a little man from
South America.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&mdash;Mr. Poritol?&#8221; Her brows were knit in
an adorable frown.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and two Japanese.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Her exclamation was apprehensive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Japanese got it,&#8221; added Orme, ruefully.
That she had the right to this information it
never occurred to him to question.
</p>
<p>The girl stood rigidly. &#8220;Whatever shall I do
now?&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;My poor father!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked helplessly at Orme. His self-possession
had returned, and as he urged her to a chair,
he condemned himself for not guessing how serious
the loss of the bill must be to her. &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Perhaps I can help. But you see, I know
so little of what it all means. Tell me everything
you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a sigh, she sank into the chair. Orme
stood before her, waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That bill tells, if I am not mistaken,&#8221; she
said, wearily, &#8220;where certain papers have been
hidden. My father is ill at our place in the country.
He must have those papers before midnight
to-morrow, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Tears came into her eyes.
Orme would have given much for the right to comfort
her. &#8220;So much depends upon finding them,&#8221;
she added&mdash;&#8220;more even than I can begin to tell
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help,&#8221; said Orme, eager to follow
those papers all over Chicago, if only it would
serve her. &#8220;Hear my story first.&#8221; Rapidly he
recounted the adventures of the evening. She listened,
eyes intent, nodding in recognition of his
description of Poritol and Alcatrante. When he
came to the account of the fight in the porter&#8217;s office
and spoke of the Japanese with the scar on
his forehead, she interrupted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! That was Maku,&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maku?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our butler. He must have overheard my
father and me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he knew the value of the papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have. I am sorry, Mr. Orme, that
you have been so roughly used.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t
hurt me in the least. And now, what is your
story? How did you get on the trail of the
bill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We came back from the East a few days ago,&#8221;
she began. &#8220;My father had to undergo a slight
operation, and he wished to have it performed by
his friend, Dr. Allison, who lives here, so we went
to our home in&mdash;one of the northern suburbs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Father could not go back East as soon as he
had expected to, and he had the papers sent to
him, by special arrangement with the&mdash;with the
other parties to the contract. Mr. Poritol followed
us from the East. I&mdash;we had known him
there. He was always amusing company; we never
took him seriously. He had business here, he said;
but on the first day of his arrival he came out to
call on us. The next night our house was entered
by a burglar. Besides the papers, only a few things
were taken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poritol?&#8221; exclaimed Orme, incredulously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It happened that a Chicago detective had been
in our village on business during the day,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;He had recognized on the streets a well-known
thief, named Walsh. When we reported
the burglary the detective remembered seeing
Walsh, and hunted him out and arrested him. In
his pockets was some jewelry belonging to me, and
in his room the other stolen articles were found&mdash;everything
except the papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you tell the police about the papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it seemed wiser not to. They were in a
sealed envelope with&mdash;with my father&#8217;s name on it,
and would surely have been returned, if found with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
the other things. There are reasons why they
would have&mdash;would try to please my father. We
did let them know that an envelope containing
something of value had not been recovered, and
told them to make a thorough search.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The afternoon after the burglary the news of
Walsh&#8217;s arrest was telephoned out to us from
Chicago. I talked with my father, who was not
well enough to leave the house, and it seemed best
that someone should go to the county jail and see
Walsh and try to get the papers. My father had
reasons for not wishing the loss to become known.
Only he and I were acquainted with the contents
of the envelope; so I insisted on going to Chicago
and interviewing the burglar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed, intercepting Orme&#8217;s admiring look.
&#8220;Oh, it was easy enough. I planned to take our
lawyer as an escort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and that is where my troubles really began.
Just as I was preparing to go, Mr. Poritol
called. I had forgotten that we had asked him
out for an afternoon of golf. He <i>is</i> such a funny
player.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I told him I was going to the Chicago
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
jail to interview a burglar about some stolen
goods, he insisted on acting as escort. He was so
amusingly persistent that I finally agreed. We set
out for the city in my car, not waiting to take
a train.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When we reached the jail I presented a letter
which my father had written, and the officials
agreed to let me have a private interview with
Walsh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme opened his eyes. This girl&#8217;s father must
have considerable influence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a horrid place, the jail. They took us
through a corridor to Walsh&#8217;s cell, and called him
to the grating. I made Mr. Poritol stand back
at the other side of the corridor so that he couldn&#8217;t
hear us talk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked the man what he had done with the
papers. He insisted that he had seen none. Then
I promised to have him freed, if he would only
return them. He looked meditatively over my
shoulders and after a moment declined the offer,
again insisting that he didn&#8217;t understand what I
was talking about. &#8216;I took the other things, miss,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;and I suppose I&#8217;ll get time for it. But
so help me, I didn&#8217;t see no papers.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>The girl paused and looked at Orme. &#8220;This
seems like wasting minutes when we might be
searching.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme was pleased to hear the &#8220;we.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I knew that the man was
not telling the truth. He was too hesitant to be
convincing. So I began to promise him money.
At every offer he looked past my shoulder and
then repeated his denials. The last time he raised
his eyes I had an intuition that something was going
on behind me. I turned quickly. There stood
Mr. Poritol, extending his fingers in the air and
forming his mouth silently into words. He was
raising my bids!
</p>
<p>&#8220;It flashed upon me that the papers would be
of immense value to Mr. Poritol&mdash;for certain reasons.
If only I had thought of it before! I spoke
to him sharply and told him to go outside. It
always seemed natural to order him about, like a
little dog.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;However, little dogs have the sharpest teeth,&#8221;
remarked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true. He replied that he couldn&#8217;t
think of leaving me alone in such a place. So
there was nothing for me to do except to go. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
would have to return later without Mr. Poritol.
&#8216;Come along,&#8217; I said. &#8216;My errand is done.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Poritol smiled at me in a way I didn&#8217;t
like. The burglar, meantime, had gone to a little
table at the back of his cell. There was an ink-bottle
there and he seemed to be writing. Looking
into the cell, Mr. Poritol said: &#8216;The poor fellow
has very unpleasant quarters.&#8217; Then he said to
Walsh: &#8216;Can&#8217;t we do something to make your
enforced stay here more comfortable, my very dear
sir?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme smiled at the unconscious mimicry of her
accent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Walsh came back to the grating. He held
in his hand a five-dollar bill&mdash;the one that has
made so much trouble. It had been smuggled in
to him in some way. &#8216;You might get me some
&#8220;baccy,&#8221;&#8217; he said, thrusting the bill through the
bars and grinning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I understood what was going on. I
reached for the bill, as though it were intended
for me, but Mr. Poritol was quicker. He snatched
the bill and put it in his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what to do. But suddenly Mr.
Poritol seemed to be frightened. Perhaps he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
thought that I would have him arrested, though
he might have known that there were reasons why
I couldn&#8217;t. He gave me a panicky look and rushed
out of the corridor. Afterward I learned that he
told the guard I had sent him on an errand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;&mdash;she sighed&mdash;&#8220;of course, I followed,
after a last glance at Walsh, who was peering
through the grating with a look of evil amusement.
He must have been well paid, that burglar.
But then,&#8221; she mused, &#8220;they could afford it&mdash;yes,
they could well afford it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I got to the street, Poritol was just
disappearing in my car! I can only think that
he had lost his head very completely, for he didn&#8217;t
need to take the car. He could have mixed with
the street-crowd and gone afoot to the hotel
where&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alcatrante?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Alcatrante&mdash;where he was stopping,
and have waited there. But Mr. Alcatrante was
playing golf at Wheaton, and Mr. Poritol seems
to have thought that he must go straight to him.
He cannot escape from being spectacular, you
see.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He ran out through the western suburbs, putting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
on more and more speed. Meantime I set a
detective on the track of the car. That is how
I learned what I am now telling you. As for the
car, Mr. Poritol sent it back to me this morning
with a hired chauffeur. He wrote a note of abject
apology, saying that he had been beside himself
and had not realized what he was doing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After setting the detective at work, I went out
to our place by train. I dreaded confessing my
failure to father, but he took it very well. We
had dinner together in his study. Maku was in
the room while we were talking. Now I can see why
Maku disappeared after dinner and did not return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did Poritol lose the bill?&#8221; asked
Orme.
</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &#8220;It was really ridiculous.
He over-speeded and was caught by one of those
roadside motor-car traps, ten or twelve miles out
in the country. They timed him, and stopped him
by a bar across the road. From what the detective
says, I judge he was frightened almost
to speechlessness. He may have thought that he
was being arrested for stealing the car. When
they dragged him before the country justice, who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
was sitting under a tree near by, he was white and
trembling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They fined him ten dollars. He had in his
pocket only eleven dollars and sixty-three cents,
and the marked bill was nearly half of the sum.
He begged them to let him go&mdash;offered them his
watch, his ring, his scarf-pin&mdash;but the justice insisted
on cash. Then he told them that the bill
had a formula on it that was valuable to him and
no one else.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The justice was obdurate, and Mr. Poritol
finally hit on the device which you have seen. It
fitted in well with his sense of the theatrical; and
the detective says that there was not a scrap of
paper at hand. The point was that Mr. Poritol
was more afraid of delay than anything else. He
knew that I would put someone on his track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When did all this happen?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday afternoon. Mr. Poritol came back
to Chicago by trolley and got some money. He
went back to the country justice and discovered
that the marked bill had been paid out. He has
followed it through several persons to you, just
as Maku did, and as I have done. But I heard
nothing of the Japanese.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have attempted this alone,&#8221;
said Orme, solicitously.
</p>
<p>She smiled faintly. &#8220;I dared not let anyone
into the secret. I was afraid that a detective
might learn too much.&#8221; She sighed wearily. &#8220;I
have been on the trail since morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did you finally get my address?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who paid the bill in at the hat-shop
lives in Hyde Park. I did not get to him until
this evening, while he was at dinner. He directed
me to the hat-shop, which, of course, was closed.
I found the address of the owner of the shop in
the directory and went to his house. He remembered
the bill, and gave me the addresses of his two
clerks. The second clerk I saw proved to be the
one who had paid the bill to you. Luckily he remembered
your address.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme stirred himself. &#8220;Then the Japanese have
the directions for finding the papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My predicament,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;is complicated
by the question whether the bill does actually
carry definite directions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It carries something&mdash;a set of abbreviations,&#8221;
said Orme. &#8220;But I could not make them out.
Let us hope that the Japanese can&#8217;t. The best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
course for us to take is to go at once to see Walsh,
the burglar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He assumed that she would accept his aid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good of you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But it seems
a little hopeless, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? What else can we do? I suppose you
saw to it that no one else should have access to
Walsh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, father arranged that by telephone. The
man is in solitary confinement. Several persons
tried to see him to-day, on the plea of being relatives.
None of them was admitted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>What money-king was this girl&#8217;s father, that he
could thus regulate the treatment of prisoners?
</p>
<p>&#8220;So there were abbreviations on the bill?&#8221; she
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. They weren&#8217;t very elaborate, and I puzzled
over them for some time. The curious fact is
that, for all my study of them, I can&#8217;t remember
much of anything about them. What I have since
been through, apparently, has driven the letters
out of my head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do try to remember,&#8221; she implored. &#8220;Even
if you recall only one or two bits of it, they may
help me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There was something about a man named
Evans,&#8221; he began. &#8220;S. R. Evans, it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Evans? That is strange. I can&#8217;t think how
anyone of that name could be involved.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then S. R. Evans is not your father?&#8221; he ventured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#8221; She laughed a light little laugh.
&#8220;My father is&mdash;but are you sure that the name
was Evans?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite sure. Then there was the abbreviation
&#8216;Chi.&#8217;&mdash;which I took to mean &#8216;Chicago.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she breathed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And there were numerals&mdash;a number, then the
letter &#8216;N.&#8217;; another number, followed by the letter
&#8216;E.&#8217; So far north, so far east, I read it&mdash;though
I couldn&#8217;t make out whether the numbers
stood for feet or paces or miles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; she whispered. Her eyes were intent
on his. They seemed to will him to remember.
&#8220;What else was there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd letters, which meant nothing to me. It&#8217;s
annoying, but I simply can&#8217;t recall them. Believe
me, I should like to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will a little later,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry to be such a bother to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bother!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it does mean so much, the tracing of this
bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we go to see Walsh?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221; She sighed. Apparently she
was discouraged. &#8220;But even if he gives the information,
it may be too late. The Japanese have
the directions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But perhaps they will not be able to make
them out,&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>She smiled. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know the Japanese,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;They are abominably clever at such
things. I will venture that they are already on
their way to the hiding-place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But even if the papers are in the pocket of
one of them, it may be possible to steal them
back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly.&#8221; She arose. &#8220;I fear that the one
chance is the mere possibility that Maku couldn&#8217;t
read the directions. Then, if Walsh <i>will</i> speak
out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let me say something,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My
name is Robert Orme. Apparently we have common
friends in the Wallinghams. When I first
saw you this afternoon, I felt that I might have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
a right to your acquaintance&mdash;a social right, if
you like; a sympathetic right, I trust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held out his hand. She took it frankly, and
the friendly pressure of her fine, firm palm sent
the blood tingling through him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I can&#8217;t give you
my name. It would be unfair just now&mdash;unfair to
others; for if you knew who I am, it might give
you a clue to the secret I guard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day, I hope, I may know,&#8221; he said
gravely. &#8220;But your present wish is my law. It
is good of you to let me try to help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the same instant they became conscious that
their hands were still clasped. The girl blushed,
and gently drew hers away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall call you Girl,&#8221; Orme added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A name I like,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My father uses
it. Oh, if I only knew what that burglar wrote
on the bill!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme started. What a fool he had been! Here
he was, trying to help the girl, forcing her to
the long, tired recital of her story, when all the
time he held her secret in the table in his sitting-room.
For there was still the paper on which he
had copied the abbreviated directions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait here,&#8221; he said sharply, and without answering
the look of surprise on her face, hurried
from the room and to the elevator. A few moments
later he was back, the sheet of paper in his
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t forgive my own stupidity,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;While I was puzzling over the bill this evening
I copied the secret on a sheet of paper. When
Poritol came I put it away in a drawer and forgot
all about it. But here it is.&#8221; He laid the paper
on the little, useless onyx table that stood beside
her chair.
</p>
<p>She snatched it quickly and began to examine it
closely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you can imagine how those letters
puzzled me,&#8221; he volunteered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she exclaimed; and then: &#8220;Oh, this is
plain. You wouldn&#8217;t know, of course, but I see it
clearly. There is no time to lose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to follow this clue now&mdash;to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maku will read it on the bill, and&mdash;oh, these
Japanese! If you have one in your kitchen, you
never know whether he&#8217;s a jinriksha man, a college
student, or a vice-admiral.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will let me go with you?&#8221; Orme was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
trembling for the answer. He was still in the
dark, and did not know how far she would feel
that she could accept his aid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may need you, Mr. Orme,&#8221; she said simply.
</p>
<p>It pleased him that she brought up no question
of possible inconvenience to him. With her, he
realized, only direct relations were possible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much of a journey is it?&#8221; he ventured
to ask.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very long. I intend to be mysterious
about it.&#8221; She smiled brightly. Her face had
lighted up wonderfully since he gave her the
paper that contained the secret of the bill.
</p>
<p>But he knew that she must be tired; so he said:
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you send me alone on this errand? It may
be late before it is done, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I will not sit and rest while you do all
the work. Besides, I cannot forego the excitement
of the chase.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was selfishly glad in her answer. &#8220;Do we
walk?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go in the motor,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I left it around the corner. The thought
came to me that Mr. Poritol might be here, and
I didn&#8217;t wish him to recognize it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>Orme thought of the hard quest the girl had
followed that day&mdash;battling for her father&#8217;s interests.
What kind of a man could that father
be to let his daughter thus go into difficulties
alone? But she had said that her father was unable
to leave the house. Probably he did not know
how serious the adventure might be. Or was the
loss of the papers so desperate that even a daughter
must run risks?
</p>
<p>Together they went out to the street. Orme
caught a dubious glance from the clerk, as they
passed through the lobby, and he resented it.
Surely anyone could see&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>The girl led the way around the corner into a
side street. There stood the car. He helped her
in and without a word saw that she was restfully
and comfortably placed in the seat next to the
chauffeur&#8217;s. She did not resist the implication of
his mastery.
</p>
<p>He cranked up, leaped to the seat beside her,
and took the levers. &#8220;Which way, Girl?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;North,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>The big car swung out in the Lake Shore Drive
and turned in the direction of Lincoln Park.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>&#8220;EVANS, S. R.&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The car ran silently through the Park and out
on the broad Sheridan Road. Orme put on as
much speed as was safe in a district where there
were so many police. From time to time the girl
indicated the direction with a word or two. She
seemed to be using the opportunity to rest, for her
attitude was relaxed.
</p>
<p>The hour was about eleven, and the streets were
as yet by no means deserted. As they swung
along Orme was pleased by the transition from
the ugliness of central Chicago to the beauty
of suburbs&mdash;doubly beautiful by night. The great
highway followed the lake, and occasionally, above
the muffled hum of the motor, Orme could hear
the lapping of the wavelets on the beach.
</p>
<p>The girl roused herself. Her bearing was again
confident and untired. &#8220;Have you been up this
way before?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Buena Park we are passing now. We
shall soon reach the city limits.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>Clouds had been gathering, and suddenly raindrops
began to strike their faces. The girl drew
her cloak more closely about her. Orme looked
to see that she was protected, and she smiled back
with a brave attempt at cheerful comradeship.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite
dry.&#8221; With that she leaned back and drew from
the tonneau a light robe, which she threw about his
shoulders.
</p>
<p>The act was an act of partnership merely, but
Orme let himself imagine an evidence of solicitude
in her thoughtfulness. And then he demanded of
himself almost angrily: &#8220;What right have I to
think such thoughts? She has known me only an
hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But to him that hour was as a year, so rich
was its experience. He found himself recalling
her every change of expression, her every characteristic
gesture. &#8220;She has accepted me as a
friend,&#8221; he thought, warmly. But the joy of the
thought was modified by the unwelcome reflection
that the girl had had no choice. Still, he knew
that, at least, she trusted him, or she would never
have let him accompany her, even though she seriously
needed protection.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>They were passing a great cemetery. The
shower had quickly ended. The white stones and
monuments fled by the car like dim and frightened
ghosts. And now the car swung along with fine
houses, set back in roomy grounds, at the left,
the lake at the right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know this city?&#8221; the girl asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. Have we passed the Chicago
limits?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We are in Evanston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Evanston!&#8221; Orme had a glimmer.
</p>
<p>The girl turned and smiled at him. &#8220;Evanston&mdash;Sheridan
Road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Evans,&mdash;S. R.!&#8221; exclaimed Orme.
</p>
<p>She laughed a low laugh. &#8220;Ah, Monsieur Dupin!&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>Speeding along the lake front, the road turned
suddenly to the left and west, skirting a large
grove of trees which hugged the shore. Just at
the turn was a low brick building on the beach.
&#8220;The life-saving station,&#8221; explained the girl;
&#8220;and these are the grounds of the university. The
road goes around the campus, and strikes the lake
again a mile or more farther north.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Large buildings were at their right after they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
turned. Orme noted that they were scattered
among the trees&mdash;some near the street, some at a
distance back. Then the road again turned to the
north, at a point where less imposing streets broke
in from the west and south.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop at this corner,&#8221; said the girl.
</p>
<p>Orme threw on the brakes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in Evanston, on the Sheridan Road,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and this street cutting in from the
south is Chicago Avenue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Chi. A.&#8217;!&#8221; exclaimed Orme.
</p>
<p>She had taken the paper from the pocket of
her coat, and was scanning it closely. &#8220;One hundred
paces north and two hundred and ten east.
&#8216;T.&#8217; must mean &#8216;tree.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme jumped to the ground. He noticed that
the university grounds were cut off from the street
by an iron fence. There was a gate at the corner
by which they had stopped. The gate was not
closed. If it were customary to shut it at night,
there had been some neglect on this particular
evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go in through the gate,&#8221; said
the girl, &#8220;and follow the west fence northward for
one hundred paces. Then turn east, at right angles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
and go two hundred and ten paces&mdash;I suppose
it must be paces, not feet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;That would be the natural
way for a burglar in a hurry to measure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will move the car north on Sheridan Road
a little way,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;so as not to be in the
glare of this street light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was the first evidence she had shown of
nervousness, and Orme suddenly realized that enemies
might be lurking among the trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be well for you to take the electric
hand-lamp,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the kit-box, I
think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked in the kit-box, but the lamp was not
there. He told her so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maku may have stolen it,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Orme slipped a heavy wrench into his pocket
and closed the kit-box. With the girl, he avoided
any reference to the possible presence of the
Japanese among the trees, but knowing that
he was no match for them unarmed, with their
skill in jiu-jitsu, he resolved to be in some measure
prepared.
</p>
<p>He walked through the gate and began to pace
northward, keeping close to the fence and counting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
his steps. Meantime the car followed his course,
moving along the side of the road just west of
the fence. Orme counted his hundred paces north,
then turned east.
</p>
<p>He saw that the two hundred and ten paces
which he now had to take would carry him well
over toward the lake. The girl evidently had not
realized how great the distance would be. She
would be nearer him, if she turned back to the
corner and followed the Sheridan Road eastward
toward the life-saving station, but Orme did not
suggest this to her, though the car was within
twenty feet of him, the other side of the fence. If
there should be a struggle, it would please him
just as well that she should be out of hearing,
for her anxiety, he knew, was already great,
though she kept it closely under control.
</p>
<p>Eastward he went through the trees. When he
had covered about half the distance he found himself
approaching the side of a large building.
There must be some mistake. Had he deviated so
widely from the course? In leaving the fence he
had taken sights as carefully as he could.
</p>
<p>Then the explanation struck him. Walsh, the
burglar, had probably paced in eastward from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
fence and come to the building just as he had.
There was no good hiding-place apparent near at
hand, and Walsh would hardly have retraced his
steps. What, then, would he have done? Orme
asked himself. Why, he would have turned north
or south.
</p>
<p>Orme looked in both directions. North and
south of the building were open driveways. Walsh
must have gone around the building, then continued
eastward. This is what Orme now proceeded
to do.
</p>
<p>Remembering the number of paces to the side
of the building, he chose the northward course,
because there was less light north of the building.
He hugged the side of the building, counting his
steps, and, after reaching the corner, turned eastward.
He now counted his paces along the northern
side of the building.
</p>
<p>When he reached the corner of the eastern side
of the building, he paced as far southward on the
eastern side as he had gone northward on the
western side, and on reaching a point due east of
the place at which he had originally come to the
building, he added the number of paces from the
fence to the building to the number of paces he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
had taken along the northern side of the building,
and continued eastward toward the lake.
</p>
<p>At the two hundredth pace he stopped to reconnoiter.
Not more than two hundred feet ahead
of him he could see dimly, through the tree trunks,
the expanse of the lake. There was no sound, no
evidence that any other person was near.
</p>
<p>He proceeded cautiously for ten paces. Many
trees were near him. He would have to examine
all of them, for it was hardly possible that he had
followed Walsh&#8217;s course with unerring exactness.
If the tree was within twenty feet of him north or
south, that was as much as he could expect.
</p>
<p>One thing was clear to him. Walsh had probably
chosen a tree that could easily be distinguished
from the others, either by its size or by some peculiarity
of form. Also, the tree must have a hollow
place in which the envelope could be concealed.
Orme now decided that Walsh must have found his
tree first and then paced westward to the fence.
The even number, one hundred paces north
from the gate, could be only a coincidence.
</p>
<p>A little to his left Orme discovered a trunk
much larger than its neighbors. It ran up
smoothly about eight feet to the first limb. An
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
agile man could easily get up to this limb and pull
himself into the branches. A cavity such as are
so common in oaks, would furnish a good place
for hiding the envelope away.
</p>
<p>He looked up. Suddenly a light appeared among
the branches. It was a short ray, striking against
the trunk. Before Orme could realize what was
happening a hand appeared in the little bar of
radiance and was inserted apparently into the
trunk of the tree. A moment later it was withdrawn.
It held an oblong of white.
</p>
<p>Involuntarily Orme took a step forward. A
twig cracked under his foot. Instantly the light
went out.
</p>
<p>Orme drew the wrench from his pocket and
stood tense. There was no other tree quite close
enough for the man above him to spring to its
branches. He would have to drop near Orme.
</p>
<p>Standing there, the wrench in his hand, Orme
felt that the advantage was his. He heard rustlings
in the branches above his head and kept himself
alert to guard against the man dropping on
his shoulders.
</p>
<p>To strike the Japanese down as he dropped
from the tree, that was his plan. But meantime,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
where was the other Japanese? Was he among
the near shadows? If so, he might even now be
creeping stealthily toward Orme. The likelihood
of such an attack was disconcerting to think of.
But as Orme was wondering about it, it occurred
to him that the man in the tree would not have
gone on guard so quickly, if his confederate were
near at hand. It was natural that he should have
put the light out, but would he not immediately
afterward have given some signal to the friend
below? And would he not take it for granted
that, were a stranger near, his watcher would have
managed to give warning? No, the other Japanese
could not be on guard.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, thought Orme, only one of them had
come on this quest. He hoped that this might
be the case. He could deal with one.
</p>
<p>The man in the tree was taking his own time to
descend. Doubtless he would await a favorable
moment, then alighting on the ground as far from
Orme as possible, make off at top speed.
</p>
<p>But now, to Orme&#8217;s surprise, a figure swung
from the lower branch apparently without haste.
Once on the ground, however, the stranger leaped
toward Orme.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>An intuition led Orme to thrust out his left arm.
It was quickly seized, but before the assailant
could twist it, Orme struck out with the wrench,
which was in his right hand. Swift though the
motion was, his opponent threw up his free arm and
partly broke the force of the blow. But the wrench
reached his forehead nevertheless, and with a little
moan, he dropped to the ground in a heap.
</p>
<p>As Orme knelt to search the man, another figure
swung from the tree and darted northward, disappearing
in the darkness. Orme did not pursue&mdash;it
was useless&mdash;but a sickening intuition told
him that the man who had escaped was the man
who had the envelope.
</p>
<p>He struck a match. The man on the ground
was moving uneasily and moaning. There was a
scar on his forehead. It was Maku.
</p>
<p>He went through the unconscious man&#8217;s pockets.
There was no envelope such as he was looking for,
but he did find a folded slip of paper which he
thrust into his own pocket. A discovery that interested
him, though it was not now important, he
made by the light of a second match. It was the
marked five-dollar bill. He would have liked to
take it as a souvenir, if for no other reason, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
time was short and Maku, who evidently was not
seriously hurt, showed signs of returning consciousness.
</p>
<p>Another occurrence also hastened him. A man
was strolling along the lake shore, not far away.
Orme had not seen his approach, though he was
distinctly outlined against the open background
of lake and sky. The stranger stopped. The
striking of the two matches had attracted his attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you lost something?&#8221; he called.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Orme replied.
</p>
<p>The man started toward Orme, as if to investigate,
and then Orme noticed that outlined on his
head was a policeman&#8217;s helmet.
</p>
<p>To be found going through the pockets of an
unconscious man was not to Orme&#8217;s liking. It
might be possible to explain the situation well
enough to satisfy the local authorities, but that
would involve delays fatal to any further effort
to catch the man with the envelope.
</p>
<p>So he jumped to his feet and ran northward,
then turned to the west. Circling about, he made
for the gate at which he had entered. His pursuer
either took the wrong lead in the darkness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
or stopped to examine Maku, if or when Orme went
through the gate and doubled back, outside the
fence, to the car, there was no sound of steps behind
him. He jumped to the chauffeur&#8217;s seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; inquired the girl, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I caught
Maku, but the man with the envelope got away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laid a hand on his arm. &#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221;
There was unconcealed anxiety in her voice.
</p>
<p>To say the things he yearned to say! To be
tender to her! But he controlled his feelings and
explained briefly what had happened, at the same
time throwing on the power and driving the car
slowly northward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know that the fellow ran northward,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;He may have worked back or he may
have gone on. He may have climbed another tree
and waited.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time they had come to the northern
limits of the grounds, but he had seen no one.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl exclaimed &#8220;Listen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme stopped the car. Somewhere from the
distance came a faint hum. &#8220;Another car!&#8221; he
muttered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, but I can do no more.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
I am tired, Mr. Orme. We cannot catch that car,
even if it does hold the man we want&mdash;and there
is no way of being sure that it does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is any place to leave you, I will go
after him alone.&#8221; He had turned the car as he
spoke and was sending it slowly southward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said wearily. &#8220;We&mdash;you must do
no more to-night. You have been so good, Mr.
Orme&mdash;to help me in a matter of which I could
tell you almost nothing. I won&#8217;t even try to
thank you&mdash;except by saying that you have understood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knew what she meant. He had met her need,
because he had known its greatness without her
telling him. His recognition of her plight had
been unaccompanied by any suggestion of ignored
conventions. No gushing thanks would have
pleased him half so much.
</p>
<p>He smiled at her wistfully. &#8220;Does it all end
here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I will not let it end here. We
are friends already; in fact, Mr. Orme, as soon
as I can do so, I will see that we are friends in
name. Can you accept as little a promise as
that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can accept any promise from you,&#8221; he said
gravely. &#8220;And now shall I take you home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not home. It is too far. But I have some
friends a few blocks away who will take me in.
Turn here, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Under her guidance he took the car through
several streets, drawing up at last before a large,
comfortable-looking place, set back from the
street, with a wide, shrub-dotted lawn before it.
Several windows were still lighted. He descended
to help her out.
</p>
<p>She hesitated. &#8220;I hate to ask it, Mr. Orme,&#8221;
she finally said, &#8220;but you can catch the trolley
back to Chicago. They will take care of the car
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;But one thing, Girl,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I am going to find that other Japanese to-morrow.
I shall get the envelope. Will you call me
up at the apartment to-morrow noon? If I am
not there, leave word where I can find you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do that. But don&#8217;t get yourself hurt.&#8221;
She let him help her to the ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At noon,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At noon. Good-night, my friend.&#8221; She offered
her hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Girl,&#8221; he said, and then he bent
over and kissed her fingers gently.
</p>
<p>He stood by the car until she had crossed the
lawn and ascended the steps&mdash;until the door
opened and admitted her.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A CHANCE LEAD</h3>
</div>

<p>To follow the girl&#8217;s suggestion and return at
once to Chicago was Orme&#8217;s intention when he said
good-night to her. The hour was close to midnight,
and the evening had been crowded so full
with bewildering adventure that he was tired.
Moreover, he looked forward to a morning that
might well test his endurance even more strenuously.
</p>
<p>He had now committed himself definitely to continue
in the field against the Japanese. Except
for his desire to serve this wonderful girl who had
come so suddenly into his life, he doubtless would
have permitted the mystery of the marked bill
to remain unsolved. But since the recovery of the
stolen papers was so important to her, he was prepared
to run any risk in the struggle.
</p>
<p>Who was she? But no, that was a question she
did not wish him to ask. She was simply &#8220;Girl&#8221;&mdash;beautiful,
tender, comprehending&mdash;his ideal incarnate.
As he stood there, hesitant, before the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
house into which she had disappeared, he pictured
her again&mdash;even to the strand of rebellious hair
which had blown across her cheek. He could discover
no fault in her perfection.
</p>
<p>A man came into view on the drive at the side
of the house: a servant to care for the car, of
course; and Orme, with the uneasy feeling of one
who has been trespassing, moved away toward the
corner of the block. He looked back, however, and
saw the newcomer clamber into the car and send
it slowly up the drive.
</p>
<p>At the same time a light illumined one of the
upper windows of the house. A shadow was thrown
on the curtain. Perhaps it was the girl herself.
What explanation had she given her friends
for appearing so late at their door? Probably
she had told them no more than that she was tired
and belated. She was not the kind of girl from
whom an elaborate explanation would be asked or
expected.
</p>
<p>Then a thought startled him. Was this, perhaps,
her home? No, she had spoken of the people
who lived here as her friends, and she would not
have tried to keep the truth from him by subterfuge.
If this were her home and she had not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
wished him to know it, she would have requested
him to leave her before they had come so far.
</p>
<p>It dawned upon him that it would not be hard
for him to learn who lived in this house, and possibly
through that knowledge to get a clue to her
identity. His heart warmed as he realized how
completely she had trusted him. His assurance
that he would not try to find out who she was had
satisfied her. And Orme knew that, if she had
been so readily assured, it was because she had
recognized the truth and devotion in him.
</p>
<p>With a happy sigh, he turned his back once and
for all and walked rapidly away. But he did not
go toward the electric-car line, which he knew must
lie a few blocks to the west. Instead, he retraced
the course they had come, for he had decided to
visit the university campus once more and try to
discover what had become of Maku, and more
especially of the other Japanese, who had secured
the papers. That he would be recognized and connected
with the attack on Maku, was unlikely.
</p>
<p>When he came to the corner of Sheridan Road
and Chicago Avenue, he hesitated for a moment.
Should he go north through the campus and seek
a trace of the Japanese who had escaped? Nearly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
half an hour had gone since the adventure among
the trees, and the man must have got completely
away by this time. Having the papers, he surely
would not linger to learn the fate of Maku.
</p>
<p>Orme found himself wondering how the Japanese
had got to Evanston. Granting that it had not
taken them long to solve the abbreviated directions
on the five-dollar bill, they could hardly have come
by motor-car, for they had had a good half-hour
start, and yet Orme had discovered them before
their work was completed. Only on the assumption
that their car had broken down on the way could
Orme admit that they had used a motor-car. Moreover,
how were two Japanese, whose appearance
did not indicate the possession of much ready
money&mdash;how were they likely to have a car, or
even to rent one? And had they believed that
they might be pursued? Would they not have
come to Evanston by an obvious route of train or
trolley.
</p>
<p>These considerations led Orme to think that
the car which he and the girl had heard in the distance
could not have been occupied by the escaping
Japanese.
</p>
<p>The fellow, then, had probably made for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
electric-car line, and in that event he would be well
on his way to Chicago by this time. The car he
had caught must have gone southward from Evanston
about ten forty-five. The conductor would
be likely to remember having had a Japanese on
board; perhaps he would even remember where the
Oriental had got off. The natural course for
Orme, therefore, was to take a car himself and, if
he did not meet the other car returning, to get off
at the car-barns and make inquiries. The possibility
that the Japanese had changed to the elevated
road on the North Side was great, but the conductor
might remember if the change had been
made.
</p>
<p>But Orme did not turn at once toward the car-line.
Though his logic pointed in that direction,
he was irresistibly influenced by a desire to walk
eastward along the drive where it skirted the southern
end of the campus. A half-hour might go by,
and still he would not be too late to meet, on its
return, the car which the Japanese would have
taken. He started, therefore, eastward, toward the
lake, throwing frequent glances through the iron
fence at his left and into the dark shadows of the
oaks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>He came to the lake without encountering anyone.
The road here swept to the southward, and
on the beach near the turn squatted the low brick
building which the girl had told him was the life-saving
station. A man was standing on the little
veranda. His suit of duck was dimly white in the
light from the near-by street-lamps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the crew,&#8221; Orme surmised, and he sauntered
slowly down the little path.
</p>
<p>The beach sloped grayly to the edge of the lake,
where a breakwater thrust its blunt nose out like
a stranded hulk. The water was calm, lapping the
sand so gently that it was hard to believe that
so gentle a murmur could ever swell into the roar
of a northeaster. A launch that was moored at
the outer end of the breakwater lay quiet on the
tideless surface.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening,&#8221; said Orme, as the man turned
his head. &#8220;Are you on watch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The life-saver slowly stretched. &#8220;Till twelve,&#8221;
he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much longer, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank heaven!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme laughed. &#8220;I suppose you do get more
than you want of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But on a fine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
night like this I should think it would be mighty
pleasant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you have to put in several hours of
study after you get through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Study?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You see, I have a special examination
to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A service examination?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;college.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a student?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the crew are students. It helps a good
deal, if you are working your way through college.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. But surely the university hasn&#8217;t
opened for the fall?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but there are preliminary exams, for those
who have conditions to work off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme nodded. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fine campus you have&mdash;with
the groves of oaks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the place for a quiet evening stroll. I
thought I&#8217;d walk up the shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a rule against going in there after
dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there? That&#8217;s too bad.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Something funny happened there just a little
while ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So? What was it?&#8221; Orme was getting close
to the subject he most desired to hear explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, one of the cops was walking along the
shore and he found a Japanese, stunned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Japanese!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He evidently had wandered in there and somebody
had hit him over the head with a club.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably. There&#8217;ve been a good many holdups
lately. But the slugger didn&#8217;t have a chance
to get anything this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was bending over the Jap when the cop
came up. He got away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the cop chase him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the fellow had a good start, so the cop
stayed by the Jap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what became of the Jap?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The life-saver jerked his head toward the door
beside him. &#8220;He&#8217;s in there, getting over his headache.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he?&#8221; This was a contingency which Orme
had not foreseen. Nor had he any desire to come
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
face to face with Maku. But if he betrayed his
surprise, the life-saver did not notice it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cop is taking another look through the
campus,&#8221; he continued.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the Jap say about it?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t say anything. It looks as though
he couldn&#8217;t speak English. The cop is going to
get Asuki.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Asuki?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Jap student who lives in the dormitory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>The fact that Maku would not talk was in a
measure reassuring. His apparent inability to
understand English was, of course, assumed, unless,
indeed, he was still too completely dazed by
the blow which Orme had given him, to use a tongue
which was more or less strange to him. But what
would he say if he saw Orme? Would he not accuse
his assailant, hoping thus to delay the pursuit
of his companion?
</p>
<p>The danger was by no means slight. Orme decided
quickly to get away from this neighborhood.
But just as he was about to bid the life-saver a
casual good-night, two men came around the corner
of the building. One was a policeman, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
other a young Japanese. Orme unobtrusively
seated himself on the edge of the little veranda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How is he?&#8221; asked the policeman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I guess,&#8221; replied the life-saver. &#8220;I
looked in a few minutes ago, and he was sitting up.
Hello, Asuki.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there,&#8221; responded the little Japanese.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the policeman, after an unsuspicious
glance at Orme, and, mounting the steps, he
led his interpreter into the station.
</p>
<p>Now, indeed, it was time for Orme to slip away.
Maku might be brought out at any moment. But
Orme lingered. He was nearer to the solution of
the secret if he kept close to Maku, and he realized,
for that matter, that by watching Maku closely
and, perhaps, following him home, he might be
led straight to the other man. If Maku accused
him, it should not, after all, be hard to laugh the
charge away.
</p>
<p>A murmur of voices came from within the station,
the policeman&#8217;s words alone being distinguishable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him,&#8221; the policeman said, &#8220;if he knows
who hit him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The undertones of a foreign jargon followed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; continued the policeman, &#8220;find
out where he came from and what he was doing on
the campus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the undertones, and afterward an interval
of silence. Then the policeman spoke in an undecided
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he don&#8217;t know anything, I can&#8217;t do anything.
But we might as well get a few more facts.
Something might turn up. Ask him whether he
saw anybody following him when he went into the
campus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme had been straining his ears in a vain endeavor
to catch the words of Asuki. But suddenly
his attention was diverted by a sound from the
lake. It was the &#8220;puh-puh-puh-puh&#8221; of a motor-boat,
apparently a little distance to the northward.
The explosions followed one another in rapid succession.
</p>
<p>He turned to the life-saver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What boat is that?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Some party from Chicago,
probably. She came up an hour or so ago&mdash;at
least, I suppose she&#8217;s the same one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The explosions were now so rapid as to make
almost one continuous roar.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a fast one, all right,&#8221; commented the life-saver.
&#8220;Hear her go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there many fast boats on the lake?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a number. They run out from Chicago
harbor now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme was meditating.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly how long ago did this boat pass?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, an hour or more. Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems to have been beached up north here
a little way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She may have been. Or they&#8217;ve been lying to
out there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In Orme&#8217;s mind arose a surmise that in this
motor-boat Maku and his companion had come
from Chicago. The surmise was so strong as to
develop quickly into a certainty. And if the Japanese
had come by this boat, it stood to reason
that the one who had the papers was escaping in
it. He must have waited some time for Maku
and, at last, had pushed off to return alone.
</p>
<p>Were these Japanese acting for themselves?
That did not seem possible. Then who was their
employer?
</p>
<p>Orme did not puzzle long over these questions,
for he had determined on a course of action. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
spoke to the life-saver, who appeared to be listening
to the droning conversation which continued
within the station.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The hold-up men may be in that boat,&#8221; remarked
Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly.&#8221; A laugh accompanied the answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why not? She came north an hour or
so ago and either was beached or lay to until just
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be right.&#8221; Then, before Orme knew
what was happening, the young man opened the
door and called into the station: &#8220;Hey, there!
Your robber is escaping on that motor-boat out
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; The policeman strode to the
door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear that boat out there?&#8221; asked
the life-saver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I hear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she came up from the south an hour or
more ago and stopped a little north of here. Now
she&#8217;s going back. Mr. Holmes, here&#8221;&mdash;he grinned
as he said it&mdash;&#8220;Mr. Holmes suggests that the
hold-up man is aboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The reference to the famous detective of fiction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
was lost upon the policeman. &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s
about it, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; he said excitedly; and
Orme was much relieved to note that the life-saver&#8217;s
humorous reference had passed for an introduction.
The policeman would have no suspicion of
him now&mdash;unless Maku&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>There was an exclamation from within the room.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked the policeman, turning
in the doorway.
</p>
<p>The voice of Asuki replied: &#8220;He say the robber
came in a bicycle&mdash;not in a boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought he didn&#8217;t see the fellow coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He remember now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The policeman started. &#8220;How did he know
what we were talking about out here?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He understand English, but not speak it,&#8221; replied
Asuki readily.
</p>
<p>To the policeman this explanation was satisfactory.
Orme, of course, found in it a corroboration
of his guess. Maku evidently did not wish
suspicion directed against the motor-boat.
</p>
<p>The policeman re-entered the station, eager to
avail himself of the information which Maku was
now disposed to give him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>Orme turned to the life-saver. &#8220;The Jap is
lying,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. If he understands English so well,
he certainly knows how to make himself understood
in it. His story of the bicycle is preposterous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it occur to you that perhaps the Jap
himself is the robber? His intended victim may
have got the better of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the young man doubtfully, &#8220;but
the fellow ran.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be natural. Doubtless he didn&#8217;t
want any notoriety. It&#8217;s possible that he thought
he had killed his assailant, and had an unpleasant
vision of being detained in the local jail until the
affair could be cleared up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The life-saver looked at Orme searchingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds pretty straight,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;I guess you know what you are talking about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I do,&#8221; said Orme quietly. &#8220;In any
event I&#8217;d like to see who&#8217;s in that boat out there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a boat nearer than Chicago that
could catch her. They have run her several miles
out into the lake before turning south, or she would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
have been pretty close to Chicago already. She&#8217;s
going fast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The roar of the motor was indeed becoming a
far-off sound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not telephone the Chicago police to intercept
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no evidence against her,&#8221; replied
Orme; &#8220;only surmises.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, as I suggested, whoever was attacked by
that Jap in there may not want notoriety.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly the distant explosions stopped&mdash;began
again&mdash;stopped. Several times they were renewed
at short intervals&mdash;&#8220;puh-puh-puh&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;puh-puh&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;puh-puh-puh-puh&#8221;&mdash;then
they ceased
altogether.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed the life-saver. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
broken down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He picked up a pair of binoculars which had
been lying on the veranda near him, and scanned
the surface of the lake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make her out?&#8221; queried Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s too small, and too far off.&#8221; He
handed the night-glass to Orme, who in turn
searched the water vainly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whose boat is that moored to the breakwater?&#8221;
asked Orme, lowering the glass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Belongs to a man here in town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would he rent it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But he lets us run it once in a while. We
keep an eye on it for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme took out his watch. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost twelve,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be relieved in a few moments.
Do you suppose I could persuade you to take me
out to the other boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The life-saver hesitated. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But my study&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be some sport, if we get within reach
of the man out there,&#8221; Orme put in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I&#8217;ll do it&mdash;though the chances are that
they will make their repairs and be off again before
we come within a mile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m much obliged to you,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;If
you would let me make it right&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For taking you out in another man&#8217;s boat?
No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. Well&mdash;my name is Orme, not
Holmes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And mine,&#8221; grinned the life-saver, &#8220;is
Porter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>A man turned in from the drive, and sauntered
toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s my relief,&#8221; said Porter. &#8220;Hello,
Kelmsley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; replied the newcomer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait till I punch the clock,&#8221; said Porter
to Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Punch the clock? Oh, I see; the government
times you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Porter went into the station for a moment; then,
returning, he exchanged a few words with the relief
and led Orme down to the breakwater. The
launch which was moored there proved to be a
sturdy boat, built for strength rather than for
speed.
</p>
<p>Orme cast off while Porter removed the tarpaulin
from the motor and made ready to turn the
wheel over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the policeman still busy with the Jap?&#8221;
Orme questioned suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t get anything out of him,&#8221; said
Orme&mdash;&#8220;except fairy-stories.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Porter started the motor and stepped forward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
to the steering-wheel. Slowly the launch pushed
out into the open lake, and the lights of the shore
receded.
</p>
<p>No sound had come from the disabled boat since
its motor stopped. Doubtless it was too far off
for the noise of repairs to be heard on the shore.
Orme peered over the dark surface of the water,
but he could see nothing except the lights of a
distant steamer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know why he went out so far,&#8221; remarked
Porter. &#8220;He is running without lights.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That in itself is suspicious, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Orme
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I suppose so&mdash;though people aren&#8217;t
always as careful as they might be. Our own
lights aren&#8217;t lighted, you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any clue at all as to where she is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only from the direction the sounds came from
just before the explosions stopped. She had headway
enough to slide some distance after that, and
I&#8217;m allowing for it&mdash;and for the currents. With
the lake as it is, she would be carried in a little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For nearly half an hour they continued straight
out toward mid-lake. Orme noticed that there was
a slight swell. The lights of Evanston were now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
mere twinkling distant points, far away over the
dark void of the waters.
</p>
<p>Porter shut off the power. &#8220;We must be pretty
near her,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>They listened intently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I steered too far south,&#8221; said Porter
at last.
</p>
<p>He threw on the power, and sent the boat northward
in slow, wide circles. The distant steamship
had made progress toward the northeast&mdash;bound,
perhaps, for Muskegon, or some other port on the
Michigan shore. She was a passenger steamer, apparently,
for lines of portholes and deck-windows
were marked by dots of light. There was no other
sign of human presence to be seen on the lake, and
Orme&#8217;s glance expectantly wandered to her lights
now and then.
</p>
<p>At last, while he was looking at it, after a fruitless
search of the darkness, he was startled by a
strange phenomenon. The lights of the steamer
suddenly disappeared. An instant later they
shone out again.
</p>
<p>With an exclamation, Orme seized the steering-wheel
and swung it over to the right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There she is,&#8221; he cried, and then: &#8220;Excuse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
me for taking the wheel that way, but I was afraid
I&#8217;d lose her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see her,&#8221; said Porter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but something dark cut off the lights of
that steamer. Hold her so.&#8221; He let go the
wheel and peered ahead.
</p>
<p>Presently they both saw a spot of blacker blackness
in the night. Porter set the motor at half-speed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got a bull&#8217;s-eye lantern?&#8221; asked
Orme in an undertone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in that locker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme stooped and lighted the lantern in the
shelter of the locker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now run up alongside,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and ask if
they need help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The outline of the disabled boat now grew more
distinct. Porter swung around toward it and
called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Need help?&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s wait, a voice replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You tow me to Chicago. I pay you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a voice which Orme recognized as that of
the Japanese who had been with Maku in the attack
at the Père Marquette.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; answered Porter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
you in to Evanston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; The tone was expostulatory. &#8220;I go
to Chicago. I fix engine pretty soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment Orme raised his lantern and directed
its light into the other boat. It shone into
the blinking eyes of the Japanese, standing by the
motor. It shone&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>Great Heaven! Was he dreaming? Orme
could not believe his eyes. The light revealed the
face of the one person he least expected to see&mdash;for,
seated on a cushion at the forward end of the
cockpit, was the girl!
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A JAPANESE AT LARGE</h3>
</div>

<p>What was the girl doing out there in mid-lake
in the company of her enemy? Orme had seen her
enter the house of her friends in Evanston; had
bidden her good-night with the understanding that
she was to make no further move in the game before
the coming morning. She must have left the
house soon after he walked away.
</p>
<p>Had she known all the time where the Japanese
was? Had she hunted him out to make terms with
him? If that were the case, her action indicated
a new and unsuspected distrust of Orme himself.
Her failure to call for help when Orme and Porter
came up in their launch seemed to show that her
presence in the other boat was voluntary. And
yet Orme could not believe that there was not some
simple explanation which she would welcome the
first chance to make. He could not doubt her.
</p>
<p>The immediate thing to do, however, was to find
out just what she desired. Suppressing his excitement,
he called out:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Girl!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the same time he turned the lantern so that
his own face was illuminated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Orme!&#8221; she cried, rising from her seat.
&#8220;You here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At your service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled, and turned his eyes for an instant on
her companion. The face of the Japanese was a
study. His eyes were narrowed to thin slits, and
his mouth was formed into a meaningless grin.
</p>
<p>Orme spoke to the Japanese in French. &#8220;Maku
has confessed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He is under arrest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The face of the Japanese did not change.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you understand?&#8221; asked Orme, still in
French.
</p>
<p>There was no answer, and Orme turned to the
Girl and said, in French.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he understands this language.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently not,&#8221; she replied, in the same
tongue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;are you there of your
own will?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he the papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;See if you can manage to get past him, and
I will help you into our boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try.&#8221; She nodded, with a brave effort to
show reassurance.
</p>
<p>Orme frowned at the Japanese. &#8220;What are
you doing with this young lady?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do understand. You understood well
enough when you robbed me this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No understand,&#8221; the Japanese repeated.
</p>
<p>The girl, meantime, had moved slowly from her
position. The two boats were close together.
Suddenly, after a swift glance from Orme, the
girl stepped to the gunwale and leaped across the
gap. Orme reached forward and caught her,
drawing her for a brief instant close into his arms
before she found her footing in the cockpit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; he whispered, and she tossed her
head with a pretty smile of relief.
</p>
<p>Porter had been standing close by, the boathook
in his hands. &#8220;Is there anything more to be
done?&#8221; he asked of Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, wait a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Japanese had made no move to prevent the
girl&#8217;s escape. Indeed, while she was leaping to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
the other boat, he balanced himself and turned to
his motor, as though to continue the work of repair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; called Orme, &#8220;you must give me
those papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No understand.&#8221; The Japanese did not even
look up from his task.
</p>
<p>Orme turned to Porter. &#8220;Give me the boathook,&#8221;
he said, and, taking it, he hooked it to the
gunwale of the other boat, drawing the two crafts
together. His intention was to use the boathook
to bring the Japanese to terms. But the Oriental
was too quick. His apparent indifference vanished,
and with a cat-like pounce, he seized the
boathook and snatched it from Orme&#8217;s grasp.
</p>
<p>The action was so unexpected that Orme was
completely taken by surprise. He made ready,
however, to leap in unarmed, but the Japanese
thrust the blunt end of the boathook at him, and
the blow, which struck him in the chest, sent him
toppling backward. He was saved from tumbling
into the cockpit by Porter, who caught him by the
shoulders and helped him to right himself. The
two boats tossed for a moment like corks in the
water.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>When Orme again leaped to the gunwale, the
Japanese was using the boathook to push the craft
apart. A final shove widened the distance to six
or eight feet. The jump was impossible. Even
if the boats had been nearer together it would
have been folly to attempt an attack.
</p>
<p>Stepping down into the cockpit, Orme bent over
the girl, who had sunk down upon a cushion. She
seemed to be content that he should play the game
for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is wrong with his motor?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Do you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She answered in an undertone: &#8220;I shut off
the gasoline-supply. He wasn&#8217;t looking. He
didn&#8217;t see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Girl!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Where
did you do it? At the tank?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Unfortunately the valve is at the carburetter.
Oh,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;we <i>must</i> get the
papers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme turned to Porter. &#8220;Are you willing to
take a risk?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything in reason.&#8221; The life-saver grinned.
&#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on,
but I&#8217;ll back you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is a good, stout tub we are in.&#8221; Orme
hesitated. &#8220;I want you to ram her nose into that
other boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Porter shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going pretty far,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know that there is warrant for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t need to be a hard bump,&#8221; Orme explained.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hurt the fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To frighten him into giving up some papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Porter looked straight into Orme&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Do
the papers belong to you?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Orme spoke quietly. &#8220;They belong
to this young lady&mdash;or, rather, to her father.
This Japanese, and the other one, there on the
shore, stole them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the lady&#8217;s name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the police&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a matter for the police. Please trust
me, Mr. Porter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The life-saver stood irresolute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If this boat is damaged, I&#8217;ll make it good five
times over,&#8221; continued Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt the boat. A few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
scratches, perhaps. It&#8217;s the other boat I&#8217;m
thinking of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty grim business, I know,&#8221; remarked
Orme.
</p>
<p>The younger man again studied Orme&#8217;s face.
&#8220;Can you give me your word that the circumstances
would justify us in ramming that boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It flashed over Orme that he had no idea what
those circumstances were. He knew only what
little the girl had told him. Yet she had assured
him again and again that the papers were of the
greatest importance. True, throughout the affair,
thus far, with the exception of the blow he
had given Maku, the persons concerned had offered
no dangerous violence. The mysterious papers
might contain information about South American
mines&mdash;as little Poritol had suggested; they might
hold the secrets of an international syndicate.
Whatever they were, it was really doubtful whether
the necessity of their recovery would justify the
possible slaying of another man.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the girl had unconsciously exaggerated
their value. Women who took a hand in business
often lost the sense of relative importance. And
yet, she had been so sure; she had herself gone to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
such lengths. Then, too, the South Americans
had hired a burglar to break into her father&#8217;s
house, and now this Japanese had abducted her.
Yes, it was a serious game.
</p>
<p>Orme answered Porter. &#8220;I give you my
word,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Porter nodded and tightened his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the very least, that fellow has tried to abduct
this young lady,&#8221; added Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Porter. &#8220;Let her go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other boat had drifted about fifty feet
away. Orme called out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there, Japanese. Will you give up the
papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No answer came.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you won&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Orme, &#8220;we are going to
ram you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; exclaimed the girl suddenly. &#8220;We
mustn&#8217;t drown him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;But we will give
him a scare.&#8221; Then, in a louder voice: &#8220;Do
you hear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The only reply was the tapping of metal on
metal. The Japanese, it seemed, was still trying
to find out what was wrong with his motor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; Orme said to Porter, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have
to try it. But use low speed, and be ready to
veer off at the last minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll try to fend with the boathook,&#8221; said
Porter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he does, I&#8217;ll get him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lasso.&#8221; Orme picked up a spare painter that
was stored under the seat, and began to tie a slip-noose.
</p>
<p>The girl now spoke. &#8220;I suppose we shall have
to do it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I wish there were a less dangerous,
a less tragic way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hardly knowing what he did, Orme laid his hand
gently on her shoulder. &#8220;It will be all right,
dear,&#8221; he whispered.
</p>
<p>If the word embarrassed her, the darkness covered
her confusion.
</p>
<p>Porter had started the motor, setting it at a
low speed, and now he was steering the boat in a
circle to gain distance for the charge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost the other boat,&#8221; exclaimed Orme,
peering into the darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s off there,&#8221; said Porter. &#8220;You can&#8217;t see
her, but I know the direction.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>He swung the launch around and headed
straight through the night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on tight,&#8221; Orme cautioned the girl, and,
coiling his lasso, he went to the bow.
</p>
<p>The launch moved steadily forward. Orme,
straining his eyes in the endeavor to distinguish the
other boat, saw it at last. It lay a few points to
starboard, and Porter altered the course of the
launch accordingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make for the stern,&#8221; called Orme, &#8220;and cripple
her propeller, if you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Another slight change in the course showed that
Porter understood.
</p>
<p>As the lessening of the distance between the two
boats made it possible to distinguish the disabled
speeder more clearly, Orme saw that the Japanese
was still tinkering with the motor. He was busying
himself as though he realized that he had no
hope of escape unless he could start his boat.
</p>
<p>Narrower, narrower, grew the intervening gap
of dark water. Orme braced himself for the
shock. In his left hand was the coiled painter; in
his right, the end of the ready noose, which trailed
behind him on the decking. It was long since he
had thrown a lariat. In a vivid gleam of memory
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
he saw at that moment the hot, dusty New Mexican
corral, the low adobe buildings, the lumbering
cattle and the galloping horses of the ranch.
There he had spent one summer vacation of his
college life. It was ten years past, but this pose,
the rope in his hand, flashed it back to him.
</p>
<p>Now they were almost on the Japanese. For
the moment he seemed to waver. He glanced at
the approaching launch, and reached uncertainly
for the boathook. Even his subtle resources
were almost at an end. Yet it did not seem to occur
to him to yield.
</p>
<p>And then, as for the hundredth time he laid his
hands on the motor, he uttered a cry. It was
plain to Orme that the cause of the supposed breakdown
had been discovered. But was there time for
the Japanese to get away? It was doubtful. He
opened the feed-pipe, and let the gasoline again
flow in. The launch was now so near that Orme
could almost have leaped the gap, but the Japanese
bent his energy to the heavy fly-wheel, tugging
at it hurriedly.
</p>
<p>The motor started. The boat began to move.
</p>
<p>Even now it looked as though the collision could
not be prevented, but the Japanese, seizing the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
steering-wheel, turned the boat so quickly to starboard
that the stern fell away from the bow of
the approaching launch. There was no crash, no
hard bump; merely a glancing blow so slight that
in that calm water it scarcely made the boats
careen.
</p>
<p>Then Orme threw his noose. The distance was
less than ten feet, and the loop spread, quick and
true, over the head of the Japanese. But, swift
though the action was, the Japanese had an instant
to prepare himself. His right arm shot up. As
Orme, jerking at the rope, tried to tighten the
noose, the hand of the Japanese pushed it over
his head and it slid over the side into the water.
In a few seconds the swift boat had disappeared in
the night.
</p>
<p>Tightening his lips grimly, Orme drew the wet
rope in and mechanically coiled it. There was
nothing to say. He had failed. So good an opportunity
to recover the papers would hardly
return.
</p>
<p>Silently he turned back to the others. Porter
had swung the launch around and was heading
toward the distant lights of Evanston. The girl
was peering in the direction whence came the sound
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
of the receding boat. Thus, for some time they
remained silent.
</p>
<p>At last the girl broke into a laugh. It was a
rippling, silvery laugh, expressing an infectious
appreciation of the humor of their situation.
Orme chuckled in spite of himself. If she could
laugh like that, he need not stay in the dumps.
And yet in his mind rankled the sense of failure.
He had made a poor showing before her&mdash;and she
was laughing. Again the corners of his mouth
drew down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the notion <i>is</i> amusing,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;a
cowboy at sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was not laughing at you.&#8221; She had
sobered quickly at his words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t blame you, if you did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the whole situation,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;And
it wouldn&#8217;t be so funny, if it weren&#8217;t so serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate it,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you know how serious it is,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;But truly, Mr. Orme, I am glad that we did not
damage that boat. It might have been terrible.
If he had been drowned&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; her voice trailed off
in a faint shudder, and Orme remembered how tired
she must be, and how deeply disappointed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Girl,&#8221; he said, bending over her and
speaking in a low voice, &#8220;try to forget it. To-morrow
I am going after the papers. I will get
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked up at him. Her eyes were softly
confident. &#8220;I believe you,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;You
never give up, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I never give up&mdash;when I am
striving for something which I greatly want.&#8221;
There was meaning in his voice, though he had
struggled to conceal it. She lowered her eyes,
and said no more.
</p>
<p>Slowly the lights of shore grew brighter. After
a time Orme could distinguish the masses of trees
and buildings, grayly illuminated by the arc-lamps
of the streets. He spoke to Porter in an undertone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you land us some distance south of the
life-saving station?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;ll run in by the Davis Street pier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be obliged to you,&#8221; Orme sighed. &#8220;I
made a bad mess of it, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied the life-saver.
&#8220;We got the lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme started. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we got the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
lady&mdash;and that&#8217;s more important than all the rest
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Porter grinned a noncommittal grin and devoted
himself to the wheel.
</p>
<p>They had saved the girl! In his disappointment
over the escape of the Japanese Orme had
forgotten, but now he silently thanked God that
Porter and he had come out on the water. The
girl had not yet explained her presence in the
boat. In her own good time she would tell him.
But she had been there under compulsion; and
Orme shuddered to think what might have happened.
</p>
<p>He stole a glance at her. She was leaning
back on the seat. Her eyes were closed and her
pose indicated complete relaxation, though it was
evident from her breathing that she was not asleep.
Orme marveled at her ability to push the nervous
excitement of the evening away and snatch the
brief chance of rest.
</p>
<p>When at last the launch ran up under the end
of a little breakwater near the Davis Street pier,
she arose quickly and sprang out of the boat without
help. Then she turned, as Orme stepped up
beside her, and spoke to Porter. &#8220;If you and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Mr. Orme had not come after me,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;there&#8217;s no telling whether I should ever have got
back. I should like to shake hands with you,&#8221; she
added; and bending down, she held out her firm
white hand.
</p>
<p>Then Orme laid his hand on the life-saver&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done a piece of good work
to-night,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Porter laughed embarrassedly. &#8220;I only ran
the boat for you,&#8221; he began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You took me at my word,&#8221; said Orme, &#8220;and
that&#8217;s a good deal in such a case. Good-by. I
will look you up before I go back East.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the side of the girl, Orme now walked slowly
through the deserted streets. It was some time
before she spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After you left me at the home of my friends&mdash;&#8221;
she began at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to tell about it,&#8221; he interrupted
quickly. &#8220;You are tired. Wait for another
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were passing under a street-lamp at the
moment, and she glanced up at him with a grateful
smile, pleased apparently by his thought of her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good of you,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;but my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
story is easily told. Let me go on with it. I explained
myself to my friends as best I could and
went to my room. Then it suddenly occurred to
me that Maku and his friend might have come to
Evanston by boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as, later, it occurred to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that the other man might be waiting
for Maku. The motor-car that we heard&mdash;there
was no good reason for thinking that our
man was in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought of those
things, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It flashed on me,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;that if I
could find the man, I might be able to buy him off.
I didn&#8217;t believe that he would dare to injure me.
There are reasons why he should not. My car
had been taken in, but I had them bring it out,
and I told them&mdash;well, that part doesn&#8217;t matter.
Enough that I made an excuse, and went out with
the car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have taken someone with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was the likelihood that the Japanese
would run, if I had a companion. As long as I
was alone, he might be willing to parley, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
thought. At least, he would not be afraid of me
alone. So I went north on Sheridan Road to the
upper end of the lower campus. There is a crossroad
there, you remember, cutting through to the
lake, and I turned in. I left the car near a house
that is there, and walked on to the edge of the
bluff.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Moored to a breakwater below was a boat,
and a man was standing near her. I called out to
him, asking what time it was. He answered,
&#8216;Don&#8217; know,&#8217; and I knew him at once to be foreign
and, probably, Japanese. So I went down
toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When he saw that I was coming, he got into
the boat. He seemed to be frightened and hurried,
and I inferred that he was about to cast off,
and I called out that I was alone. At that he
waited, but he did not get out of the boat, and I
was standing at the edge of the breakwater, just
above him, before he actually seemed to recognize
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know him?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw him before to my knowledge; but
he made an exclamation which indicated that he
knew me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him that I wished to talk to him about
the papers. His answer was that, if I would step
down into the boat, he would talk. He said that
he would not leave the boat, and added that he was
unwilling to discuss the matter aloud. And I
was foolish enough to believe his excuses. If he
wished to whisper, I said to myself, why, I would
whisper. I never felt so like a conspirator.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She paused to look up at the street-sign at the
corner which they had reached, and turned to the
right on a shady avenue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I got into the boat,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I
told him that I&mdash;my father was prepared to pay
him a large sum of money for the papers, but he
only shook his head and said, &#8216;No, no.&#8217; I named
a sum; then a larger one; but money did not seem
to tempt him, though I made the second offer as
large as I dared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How much <i>will</i> you take then?&#8217; I asked at
last. Instead of answering, he bent down and
started the motor, and then I noticed for the first
time that while I was talking we had been drifting
away from the dock. I made ready to jump overboard.
We were near the shore, and the water
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
was not deep; anyway, I am a fair swimmer.
But he turned and seized my wrists and forced me
down into the bottom of the boat. I struggled,
but it was no use, and when I opened my mouth to
scream, he choked me with one hand and with the
other pulled from his pocket a handkerchief and
tried to put it in my mouth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave a weary little laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was such a crumpled, unclean handkerchief,
I couldn&#8217;t have stood it. So I managed to gasp
that, if he would only let me alone, I would keep
quiet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The brute!&#8221; muttered Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think he intended to hurt me.
What he feared, as nearly as I can make out, is
that I might have him intercepted if he let me go
free. That must have been why he tried to take
me with him. Probably he planned to beach the
boat at some unfrequented point on the North
Side and leave me to shift for myself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When your boat came, of course I didn&#8217;t
know who was in it. I never dreamed it would be
you. And I had promised to keep still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly a binding promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, before he stopped threatening me with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
that awful handkerchief, he had made me swear
over and over that I would not call for help, that
I would not make any signal, that I would sit
quietly on the seat. When you recognized me, I
felt that all need of observing the promise was
over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; muttered Orme.
</p>
<p>She sighed. &#8220;It does seem as though Fate had
been against us,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fate is fickle,&#8221; Orme returned. &#8220;You never
know whether she will be your friend or your
enemy. But I believe that she is now going to be
our friend&mdash;for a change. To-morrow I shall
get those papers.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE TRAIL OF MAKU</h3>
</div>

<p>When for the second time that night he bade the
girl adieu and saw her enter the house of her
friends, Orme went briskly to the electric-car line.
</p>
<p>He had not long to wait. A car came racing
down the tracks and stopped at his corner. Swinging
aboard at the rear platform, he glanced within.
There were four passengers&mdash;a man and woman
who, apparently, were returning from an evening
party of some sort, since he was in evening dress
and she wore an opera-cloak; a spectacled man,
with a black portfolio in his lap; a seedy fellow
asleep in one corner, his head sagging down on
his breast, his hands in his trousers pockets; and&mdash;was
it possible? Orme began to think that Fate
had indeed changed her face toward him, for the
man who sat huddled midway of the car, staring
straight before him with beady, expressionless
eyes, was Maku.
</p>
<p>Under the brim of his dingy straw hat a white
bandage was drawn tight around his head&mdash;so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
tight that from its under edge the coarse black
hair bristled out in a distinct fringe. The blow
of the wrench, then, must have cut through the
skin.
</p>
<p>Well&mdash;that would mean one more scar on the
face of the Japanese.
</p>
<p>The other scar, how had Maku come by that?
Perhaps in some battle with the Russians in Manchuria.
He seemed to be little more than a boy,
but then, one never could guess the age of a Japanese,
and for that matter, Orme had more than
once been told that the Japanese had begun to
impress very young soldiers long before the battle
of Mukden.
</p>
<p>While making these observations, Orme had
drawn his hat lower over his eyes. He hoped to
escape recognition, for this opportunity to track
Maku to his destination was not to be missed. He
also placed himself in such a position on the platform
that his own face was partly concealed by
the cross-bars which protected the windows at the
end of the car.
</p>
<p>In his favor was the fact that Maku would not
expect to see him. Doubtless the Japanese was
more concerned with his aching head than with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
any suspicion of pursuit, though his somewhat indeterminate
profile, as visible to Orme, gave no
indication of any feeling at all. So Orme stood
where he could watch without seeming to watch,
and puzzled over the problem of following Maku
from the car without attracting attention.
</p>
<p>The refusal of the other Japanese to accept
the girl&#8217;s offer of money for the papers had given
Orme a new idea of the importance of the quest.
Maku and his friend must be Japanese government
agents&mdash;just as Poritol and Alcatrante were unquestionably
acting for their government. This,
at least, was the most probable explanation that
entered Orme&#8217;s mind. The syndicate, then,&mdash;or
concession, or whatever it was&mdash;must be of genuine
international significance.
</p>
<p>Though Orme continued to smother his curious
questionings as to the meaning of the secret, he
could not ignore his general surmises. To put
his confidence in the girl&mdash;to act for her and for
her alone&mdash;that was enough for him; but it added
to his happiness to think that she might be leading
him into an affair which was greater than any
mere tangle of private interests. He knew too,
that, upon the mesh of private interests, public
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
interests are usually woven. The activity of a
Russian syndicate in Korea had been the more or
less direct cause of the Russo-Japanese War; the
activity of rival American syndicates in Venezuela
had been, but a few years before, productive of
serious international complications. In the present
instance, both South Americans and Japanese were
interested. But Orme knew in his soul that there
could be nothing unworthy in any action in which
the girl took part. She would not only do nothing
unworthy; she would understand the situation
clearly enough to know whether the course which
offered itself to her was worthy or not.
</p>
<p>In events such as she had that night faced with
him, any other girl Orme had ever met would have
shown moments of weakness, impatience, or fear.
But to her belonged a calm which came from a
clear perception of the comparative unimportance
of petty incident. She was strong, not as a man
is strong, but in the way a woman should be
strong.
</p>
<p>The blood went to his cheeks as he remembered
how tenderly he had spoken to her in the
boat, and how plain he had made his desire for
her. What should he call his feeling? Did love
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
come to men as suddenly as this? She had not
rebuked him&mdash;there was that much to be thankful
for; and she must have known that his words were
as involuntary as his action in touching her shoulder
with his hand.
</p>
<p>But how could she have rebuked him? She was,
in a way, indebted to him. The thought troubled
him. Had he unintentionally taken advantage
of her gratitude by showing affection when
she wished no more than comradeship? And had
she gently said nothing, because he had done something
for her? If her patience with him were thus
to be explained, it must have been based upon her
recognition of his unconsciousness.
</p>
<p>Still, the more he pondered, the more clearly
he saw that she was not a girl who, under the
spell of friendly good will, would permit a false
situation to exist. Her sincerity was too deep
for such a glossing of fact. He dared assume,
then, that her sympathy with him went even so
far as to accept his attitude when it was a shade
more than friendly.
</p>
<p>More than friendly! Like a white light, the
truth flashed upon him as he stood there on the
rocking platform of the car. He and she would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
have to be more than friendly! He had never
seen her until that day. He did not even know
her name. But all his life belonged to her, and
would belong to her forever. The miracle which
had been worked upon him, might it not also have
been worked upon her? He felt unworthy, and
yet she might care&mdash;might already have begun to
care&mdash;But he put the daring hope out of his mind,
and looked again at Maku.
</p>
<p>The Japanese had not moved. His face still
wore its racial look of patient indifference; his
hands were still crossed in his lap. He sat on the
edge of the seat, in order that his feet might rest
on the floor, for his legs were short; and with
every lurch of the car, he swayed easily, adapting
himself to the motion with an unconscious ease
that betrayed supple muscles.
</p>
<p>The car stopped at a corner and the man and
woman got out, but Maku did not even seem to
glance at them. Orme stepped back to make way
for them on the platform, and as they descended
and the conductor rang the bell, he looked out at
the suburban landscape, with its well-lighted, macadamized
streets, its vacant lots, and its occasional
houses, which seemed to be of the better
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
class, as nearly as he could judge in the uncertain
rays of the arc-lamps. He turned to the
conductor, who met his glance with the look of
one who thirsts to talk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;People used to go to parties in carriages and
automobiles,&#8221; said the conductor, &#8220;but now they
take the car when they&#8217;ve any distance to go.
It&#8217;s quicker and handier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think that <i>would</i> be so, here in the
suburbs,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this ain&#8217;t the suburbs. We crossed the
city limits twenty minutes ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t carry many passengers this time
of night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends. Sometimes we have a crowd.
To-night there&#8217;s hardly anyone. Nobody else is
likely to get on now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s only a short way now to the connection
with the elevated road. People who want to go
the rest of the way by the elevated, would walk.
And after we pass the elevated there&#8217;s other car-lines
they&#8217;re more likely to take, where the cars
run frequenter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you go to the heart of the city?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, we stop at the barns. Say, have you
noticed that Jap in there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The conductor nodded toward Maku.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was put aboard by a cop. Looks as though
somebody had slugged him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; commented Orme. &#8220;His head is
bandaged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Judging from the bandage, it must have been
a nasty crack,&#8221; continued the conductor. &#8220;But
you wouldn&#8217;t know he&#8217;d been hurt from his face.
Say, you can&#8217;t tell anything about those Johns
from their looks, can you, now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly can&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Orme.
</p>
<p>The conductor glanced out. &#8220;There&#8217;s the
elevated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go in and wake
that drunk. He gets off here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme watched the conductor go to the man who
was sleeping in the corner and shake him. The
man nodded his head vaguely, and settled back into
slumber. Through the open door came the conductor&#8217;s
voice: &#8220;Wake up!&#8221;&mdash;Shake&mdash;&#8220;You get
off here!&#8221;&mdash;Shake&mdash;&#8220;Wake up, there!&#8221; But
the man would not awaken.
</p>
<p>Maku was sitting but a few feet from the sleeping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
man. He had not appeared to notice what was
going on, but now, just as the conductor seemed
about to appeal to the motorman for help, the
little Japanese slid along the seat and said to
the conductor: &#8220;I wake him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The conductor stared, and scratched his head.
&#8220;If you can,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;it&#8217;s more&#8217;n I can
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Maku did not answer, but putting his hand behind
the sleeping man&#8217;s back, found some sensitive
vertebra. With a yell, the man awoke and
leaped to his feet. The conductor seized him by
the arm and led him to the platform.
</p>
<p>The car was already slowing down, but without
waiting for it to stop, the fellow launched himself
into the night, being preserved from falling
by the god of alcohol, and stumbled away toward
the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see the Jap?&#8221; exclaimed the conductor.
&#8220;Stuck a pin into him, that&#8217;s what he
did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess not,&#8221; laughed Orme. &#8220;He touched
his spine, that was all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The car stopped. The spectacled passenger
with the portfolio arose and got off by way of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
front platform. Would Maku also take the elevated?
If he did, unless he also got off the front
platform, Orme would have to act quickly to keep
out of sight.
</p>
<p>But Maku made no move. He had returned to
his former position, and only the trace of an elusive
smile on his lips showed that he had not forgotten
the incident in which he had just taken
part. Meantime Orme had maintained his partial
concealment, and though Maku had turned his
head when he went to the conductor&#8217;s help, he had
not appeared to glance toward the back platform.
</p>
<p>The conductor rang the bell, and the car started
forward again with its two passengers&mdash;Maku
within, Orme without&mdash;the pursuer and the pursued.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought the motorman and I was going to
have to chuck that chap off,&#8221; commented the conductor.
&#8220;If the Jap hadn&#8217;t stuck a pin into
him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was a pin. The Japanese know
where to touch you so that it will hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I didn&#8217;t even like to rub the fellow&#8217;s ears
for fear of hurtin&#8217; him. I heard of a man that
was made deaf that way. Smashed his ear-drums.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where the Jap will get off?&#8221; said
Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll go right through to the barns and
take a Clark Street car. There&#8217;s a lot of them
Japs lives over that way. He&#8217;ll be one of &#8217;em, I
guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s cook or valet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he is. But, of course, you never
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;One never knows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the car plunged onward, Maku suddenly put
his hand in his pocket. He drew it out empty.
On his face was an expression which may mean
&#8220;surprise,&#8221; among the Japanese. He then fumbled
in his other pockets, but apparently he did not
find what he was looking for. Orme wondered
what it might be.
</p>
<p>The search continued. A piece of twine, a pocket-knife,
a handkerchief, were produced in turn
and inspected. At last he brought out a greenback,
glancing at it twice before returning it to
his pocket. Orme knew that it must be the marked
bill. But Maku was looking for something else.
His cheek glistened with perspiration; evidently
he had lost something of value. After a time, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
he stopped hunting his pockets, and seemed
to resign himself to his loss&mdash;a fact from which
Orme gathered that the object of his search was
nothing so valuable that it could not be replaced.
</p>
<p>When he had been quiet for a time, he again
produced the greenback, and examined it attentively.
From the way he held it, Orme judged
that he was looking at the well-remembered legend:
&#8220;Remember Person You Pay This To.&#8221; Presently
he turned it over and held it closer to his
eyes. He was, of course, looking at the abbreviated
directions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think that Jap had never seen money
before,&#8221; remarked the conductor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he hasn&#8217;t&mdash;that kind,&#8221; replied Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he guesses it&#8217;s a counterfeit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as though he was trying to read the
fine print on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something you and I never have done, I imagine,&#8221;
said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; the conductor chuckled. &#8220;I
never noticed anything about a bill except the
color of it and the size of the figure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is quite enough for most men.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! But I bet I pass on a lot of counterfeits
without knowin&#8217; it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely. The Jap has evidently finished his
English lesson. See how carefully he folds the
bill before he puts it away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re comin&#8217; to the barns,&#8221; said the conductor.
&#8220;Far as we go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke, the car slowed down and stopped,
and Maku arose from his seat. Orme was at the
top of the steps, ready to swing quickly to the
ground, if Maku left the car by the rear door.
But the Japanese turned to the forward entrance.
Orme waited until Maku had got to the ground,
then he, too, descended.
</p>
<p>Maku did not turn at once toward the Clark
Street car that was waiting to start down-town.
He stood hesitant in the street. After a moment,
his attention seemed to be attracted by the lights
of an all-night restaurant, not far away, and he
crossed the street and walked rapidly to the gleaming
sign.
</p>
<p>Orme followed slowly, keeping on the other side
of the street. If Maku was hungry, why, Maku
would eat, while he himself would wait outside like
a starving child before a baker&#8217;s window. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Maku, it seemed, was not hungry. Through the
window Orme saw him walk to the cashier&#8217;s desk
and apparently ask a question. In answer, the
woman behind the desk-pointed to a huge book
which lay on the counter near by. Orme recognized
it as the city directory.
</p>
<p>For some time Maku studied the pages. Then
he seemed to appeal to the cashier for help, for
she pulled the book to her, looked at him as though
she were asking a question, and then, rapidly running
through the leaves, placed her finger at a
certain part of a certain page and turned the
book around so that the Japanese could see. He
nodded and, after bowing in a curious fashion,
came back to the street.
</p>
<p>Orme had, meantime, walked on for a little way.
He would have gone to the restaurant in an endeavor
to find out what address Maku had wished,
but for two reasons: The cashier might refuse to
tell him, or she might have forgotten the name.
In either event his opportunity to follow Maku
would thus be lost&mdash;and to follow Maku was still
his best course. Accordingly he watched the Japanese
go back to a Clark Street car and climb
aboard.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>It was an open car, with transverse seats, and
Maku had chosen a position about two-thirds of
the way back. There was, as yet, only one other
passenger. How to get aboard without being seen
by Maku was a hard problem for Orme, but he
solved it by taking a chance. Walking rapidly
toward the next corner, away from the car, he
got out of the direct rays of the street-lamp,
and waited.
</p>
<p>Presently the car started. It almost reached
Orme&#8217;s corner when he signaled it and, hurrying
into the street, swung on to the back platform.
</p>
<p>There had been barely time for the car to slow
down a little. Maku could not well have seen him
without turning his head, and Orme had watched
the little Japanese closely enough to know that he
had continued to stare straight before him.
</p>
<p>Safe on the back platform, a desire to smoke
came to Orme. He found a cigar in his case and
lighted it. While he was shielding the match, he
looked over his hollowed hand and saw Maku produce
a cigarette and light it. The Japanese had
apparently wished the consolation of tobacco just
as Orme had.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An odd coincidence,&#8221; muttered Orme. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
hope it wasn&#8217;t mind-reading.&#8221; And he smiled as
he drew a mouthful of smoke.
</p>
<p>Lincoln Park slid by them on the left. The car
was getting well down into the city. Suddenly
Maku worked along to the end of his seat and got
down on the running-board. The conductor pulled
the bell. The car stopped and the Oriental
jumped off.
</p>
<p>The action had been so quick that Orme, taken
off his guard, had not had time to get off first.
He, therefore, remained on the car, which began
to move forward again. Looking after Maku, he
saw that the Japanese, glancing neither to right
nor to left, was making off down the side street, going
west; so he in turn stepped to the street, just
as Maku disappeared beyond the corner. He hurried
quickly to the side street and saw Maku, half
a block ahead, walking with short, rapid steps.
How had Maku got so far? He must have run
while Orme was retracing the way to the corner.
And yet Maku seemed to have had no suspicion
that he was being followed.
</p>
<p>The chase led quickly to a district of poor
houses and shops&mdash;an ill-looking, ill-smelling district,
where every shadow seemed ominous. Whenever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
they approached a corner, Orme hurried forward,
running on his toes, to shorten the distance
in the event that Maku turned, but the course continued
straight until Orme began to wonder
whether they were not getting near to the river,
one branch of which, he knew, ran north through
the city.
</p>
<p>At last Maku turned into an alley, which cut
through the middle of a block. This was something
which Orme had not expected. He ran forward
and peered down the dark, unpleasant passage.
There was his man, barely visible, picking
a careful way through the ash-heaps and avoiding
the pestilential garbage-cans.
</p>
<p>Orme followed, and when Maku turned west
again at the next street, swung rapidly after him
and around the corner, with the full expectation
of seeing him hurrying along, half a block away.
But no one was in sight. Had he slipped into
one of the near-by buildings?
</p>
<p>While Orme was puzzling, a voice at his elbow
said, &#8220;Hello!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned with a start. Flattened in a shadowed
niche of the wall beside him was Maku!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; the Japanese said again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; exclaimed Orme sharply, trying to
make the best of the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mus&#8217; not follow me.&#8221; The Japanese
spoke impassively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you in a mirror at the other end of car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So that was it! Orme remembered no mirror,
but the Japanese might apply the word to the
reflecting surface of one of the forward windows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You lit a match,&#8221; continued Maku. &#8220;I saw.
Then I come here, to find if you follow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme considered. Now that he was discovered,
it would be futile to continue the chase, since
Maku, naturally, would not go to his destination
with Orme at his heels. But he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t order me off the streets, Maku.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. If you follow, then we walk an&#8217; walk
an&#8217; walk&mdash;mebbe till nex&#8217; week.&#8221; Orme swore under
his breath. It was quite clear that the little
Japanese would never rejoin the man who had the
papers until he was sure that he had shaken off his
pursuer. So Orme simply said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Disappointed, baffled, he turned eastward and
walked with long strides back toward the car-line.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
He did not look to see whether Maku was
behind him. That did not matter now. He had
missed his second opportunity since the other Japanese
escaped him in the university campus.
</p>
<p>Crossing North Clark Street a block north of
the point at which he and Maku had left the car,
he continued lakeward, coming out on the drive
only a short distance from the Père Marquette,
and a few minutes later, after giving the elevator-boy
orders to call him at eight in the morning, he
was in his apartment, with the prospect of four
hours of sleep.
</p>
<p>But there was a final question: Should he return
to the all-night restaurant near the car-barns and
try to learn from the cashier the address which
Maku had sought? Surely she would have forgotten
the name by this time. Perhaps it was a
Japanese name, and, therefore, the harder to remember.
True, she might remember it; if it were
a peculiar combination of letters, the very peculiarity
might have fixed it in her mind. And if he
hesitated to go back there now, the slim chance
that the name remained with her would grow
slimmer with every added moment of delay. He
felt that he ought to go. He was dog-tired, but&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
remembered the girl&#8217;s anxiety. Yes, he would
go; with the bare possibility that the cashier
would remember and would be willing to tell him
what she remembered, he would go.
</p>
<p>He took up his hat and stepped toward the
door. At that moment he heard a sound from
his bedroom. It was an unmistakable snore. He
tip-toed to the bedroom door and peered within.
Seated in an arm-chair was a man. He was distinctly
visible in the light which came in from
the sitting-room, and it was quite plain that he
was sound asleep and breathing heavily. And now
for the second time his palate vibrated with the
raucous voice of sleep.
</p>
<p>Orme switched on the bedroom lights. The man
opened his eyes and started from the chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;the detective, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Detective?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;regular force.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Regular force?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger pulled back his coat and displayed
his nickeled star.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are you doing here?&#8221; gasped Orme,
amazed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, a foreign fellow came to the chief and
said you wanted a man to keep an eye on your
quarters to-night&mdash;and the chief sent me. I was
dozing a bit&mdash;but I&#8217;m a light sleeper. I wake at
the least noise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme smiled reminiscently, thinking of the snore.
&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;was it Senhor Alcatrante
who had you sent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that <i>was</i> his name.&#8221; He was slowly
regaining his sleep-benumbed wits. &#8220;That reminds
me,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;He gave me a note
for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An envelope was produced from an inside pocket.
Orme took it and tore it open. The sheet
within bore the caption, &#8220;Office of The Chief of
Police,&#8221; and the few lines, written beneath in fine
script, were as follows:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mr. Orme:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, I am sure, pardon my seeming
over-anxiety for your safety, and the safety
of Poritol&#8217;s treasure, but I cannot resist using my
influence to see that you are well-protected to-night
by what you in America call &#8216;a plain-clothes
man.&#8217; I trust that he will frighten away the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Yellow Peril and permit you to slumber undisturbed.
If you do not wish him inside your apartment,
he will sit in the hall outside your door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With all regard for your continued good
health, believe me, dear Mr. Orme,
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-right:10%; margin-bottom:0'>&#8220;Yours, etc., etc.,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; font-variant: small-caps;'>&#8220;Pedro Alcatrante.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>In view of everything that had happened since
the note was penned, Orme smiled a grim smile.
Alcatrante must have been very anxious indeed;
and yet, considering that the minister knew nothing
of Orme&#8217;s encounter with the Japanese and
his meeting with the girl, the sending of the detective
might naturally have been expected to pass
as an impressive, but friendly, precaution.
</p>
<p>The detective was rapidly losing his self-assurance.
&#8220;I had only been asleep for a moment,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Orme spoke indifferently. &#8220;Well, you
may go now. There is no longer any need of you
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But my instructions&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were given under a misapprehension. My return
makes your presence unnecessary. Good-night&mdash;or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
good-morning, rather.&#8221; He nodded toward
the door.
</p>
<p>The detective hesitated. &#8220;Look a here!&#8221; he
suddenly burst out. &#8220;I never saw you before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I you,&#8221; replied Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how do I know that you are Mr. Orme?
You may be the very chap I was to keep out, far
as I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough, I may be,&#8221; said Orme dryly,
adding&mdash;&#8220;But I am not. Now go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective narrowed his eyebrows. &#8220;Not
without identification.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask the night-clerk,&#8221; exclaimed Orme impatiently.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that I don&#8217;t wish to be
bothered any longer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went over to the door and threw it open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Well, here then&#8221;&mdash;as
the detective did not move&mdash;&#8220;here&#8217;s my card.
That ought to do you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took a card from his pocket-case and offered
it to the detective, who, after scrutinizing it for a
moment, let it fall to the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right, I guess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
what shall I say to the chief?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply say that I didn&#8217;t need you any longer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>The detective picked up his hat and went.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven!&#8221; exclaimed Orme as he closed
the door. &#8220;But I wonder why I didn&#8217;t notice his
hat. It was lying here in plain sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went to the telephone and spoke to the
clerk. &#8220;Did you let that detective into my apartment?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Mr. Orme. He was one of the regular
force, and he said that you wanted him here.
I called up the chief&#8217;s office, and the order was
corroborated. I meant to tell you when you came
in, but you passed the desk just while I was down
eating my supper. The elevator-boy let you in,
didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Never mind, it&#8217;s all right. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when Orme examined his traveling-bag, he
found that someone had evidently made a search
through it. Nothing had been taken, but the orderly
arrangement of his effects had been disturbed.
His conclusion was that Alcatrante had
bribed the fellow to go much farther than official
zeal demanded. Doubtless the minister had paid
the detective to hunt for a marked five-dollar bill
and make a copy of whatever was written on it&mdash;which
would have been quite a safe proceeding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
for the detective, if he were not caught at the
task. A subtle man, Alcatrante; but no subtler
than the Japanese.
</p>
<p>Dismissing the incident from his mind, Orme
again made ready to return to the all-night restaurant.
He paused at the door, however, to give
the situation a final analysis. Maku had lost
something. After hunting for it vainly, he had
gone to the city directory for information which
appeared to satisfy him. Then what he lost must
have been an address. How would he have been
likely to lose it?
</p>
<p>Orme&#8217;s fatigue was so great that he repeated the
question to himself several times without seeing
any meaning in it. He forced his tired brain back
to the first statement. Maku had lost something.
Yes, he had lost something. What was it he had
lost? Oh, yes, a paper.
</p>
<p>It was futile. His brain refused to work.
</p>
<p>Maku had lost a paper. A paper?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Orme was awake now.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How stupid!&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>For he had entirely forgotten the paper which
he had taken from the pocket of the unconscious
Maku, there on the campus! He had thrust it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
into his pocket without looking at it, and in the
excitement of his later adventures it had passed
utterly from his memory.
</p>
<p>Another moment and he had the paper in his
hand. His fingers shook as he unfolded it, and
he felt angry at his weakness. Yes, there it was&mdash;the
address&mdash;written in an unformed hand. If
he had only thought of the paper before, he would
have been saved a deal of trouble&mdash;would have
had more sleep. He read it over several times&mdash;&#8220;Three
forty-one, North Parker Street&#8221;&mdash;so
that he would remember it, if the paper should be
lost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Maku didn&#8217;t write it in Japanese!&#8221;
he exclaimed.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>NUMBER THREE FORTY-ONE</h3>
</div>

<p>When Orme was aroused by the ringing of his
telephone-bell the next morning and heard the
clerk&#8217;s voice, saying over the wire, &#8220;Eight o&#8217;clock,
sir,&#8221; it seemed as if he had been asleep but a few
minutes.
</p>
<p>During breakfast he reviewed the events of the
preceding evening. Strange and varied though
they had been, his thoughts chiefly turned to the
girl herself, and he shaped all his plans with the
idea of pleasing her. The work he had set for
himself was to get the envelope and deliver it to
the girl. This plan involved the finding of the man
who had escaped from the tree.
</p>
<p>The search was not so nearly blind as it would
have been if Orme had not found that folded slip
of paper in Maku&#8217;s pocket. The address, &#8220;three
forty-one North Parker Street,&#8221; was unquestionably
the destination at which Maku had expected
to meet friends.
</p>
<p>To North Parker Street, then, Orme prepared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
to go. Much as he longed to see the girl again,
he was glad that they were not to make this adventure
together, for the reputation of North
Parker Street was unsavory.
</p>
<p>Orme found his way readily enough. There
was not far to go, and he preferred to walk. But
before he reached his destination he remembered
that he had promised Alcatrante and Poritol to
meet them at his apartment at ten o&#8217;clock.
</p>
<p>His obligation to the two South Americans
seemed slight, now that the bill had passed from
his hands and that he knew the nature of Poritol&#8217;s
actions. Nevertheless, he was a man of his word,
and he hurried back to the Père Marquette, for
the hour was close to ten. He was influenced to
some extent by the thought that Poritol and Alcatrante,
on learning how he had been robbed of
the bill, might unwittingly give him a further
clue.
</p>
<p>No one had called for him. He waited till ten
minutes past the hour, before he concluded that he
had fulfilled his part of the bargain with them.
Though he did not understand it, he attached no
especial significance to their failure to appear.
</p>
<p>Once again he went to North Parker Street.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Three forty-one proved to be a notion shop.
Through the window he saw a stout woman reading
a newspaper behind the counter. When he entered
she laid the paper aside and arose languidly, as
though customers were rather a nuisance than a
blessing. She was forty, but not fair.
</p>
<p>Orme asked to see a set of studs. She drew a
box from a show-case and spread the assortment
before him.
</p>
<p>He selected a set and paid her, offering a ten-dollar
bill. She turned to a cash register and
made change&mdash;which included a five-dollar bill.
</p>
<p>Orme could hardly believe his eyes. The bill
which she placed in his hand bore the written
words: &#8220;Remember Person you pay this to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned it over. In the corner was a familiar
set of abbreviations. There was no doubt about
it. The bill was the same which had been taken
from him, and which he had last seen in the possession
of Maku.
</p>
<p>What an insistent piece of green paper that
marked bill was! It had started him on this remarkable
series of adventures. It had introduced
excitable little Poritol and the suave Alcatrante
to his apartment. It had made him the victim of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the attack by the two Japanese. It had brought
the girl into his life. And now it came again into
his possession just at the moment to prove that
he was on the right track in his search for Maku
and the man who had the papers. The queerest
coincidence was that the bill would never have come
into his possession at all, had it not been for his
first meeting with the girl&mdash;who at that very
time was herself searching for it. The rubbing
of his hat against the wheel of her car&mdash;on
so little thing as that had hinged the
events that followed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is strange,&#8221; Orme addressed the woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t hurt it any,&#8221; said the woman, indifferently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that. But it&#8217;s a curious thing just
the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman raised her shoulders slightly, and
began to put away the stock she had taken out for
Orme&#8217;s benefit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who paid this to you?&#8221; persisted Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I remember? I can&#8217;t keep track
of all the persons that come in the store during
the day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I should think that anything so queer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
as this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He saw that he could get nothing
from her except by annoying her.
</p>
<p>The woman glared. &#8220;What you a botherin&#8217;
about? Why don&#8217;t you leave well enough alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme smiled. &#8220;Tell me one thing,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;do you know a Japanese that lives hereabouts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the woman, &#8220;so you&#8217;re one of the
gentlemen he was expectin&#8217;, eh? Well, it&#8217;s the front
flat, two flights up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Orme. He walked out to
the street, whence a backward glance showed him
the woman again concealed in her newspaper.
</p>
<p>At one side of the shop he found the entrance to
a flight of stairs which led to the floors above. In
the little hallway, just before the narrow ascent
began, was a row of electric buttons and names,
and under each of them a mail-box. &#8220;3a&#8221; had a
card on which was printed:
</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Arima, Teacher of Original Kano Jiu-Jitsu</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Should he go boldly up and present himself as a
prospective pupil? If Arima were the one who
had so effectively thrown him the night before, he
would certainly remember the man he had thrown
and would promptly be on his guard. Also, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
woman in the shop had said, &#8220;you are <i>one</i> of the
gentlemen he was expectin&#8217;.&#8221; Others were coming.
</p>
<p>Prudence suggested that he conceal himself in
an entry across the street and keep an eye out
for the persons who were coming to visit Arima.
He assumed that their coming had something to
do with the stolen paper. But he had no way of
knowing who the athlete&#8217;s guests would be. There
might be no one among them whom he could recognize.
And even if he saw them all go in, how
would his own purpose be served by merely watching
them? In time, no doubt, they would all come
out again, and one of them would have the papers
in his possession, and Orme would not know which
one.
</p>
<p>For all he was aware, some of the guests had
already arrived. They might even now be gathering
with eager eyes about the unfolded documents.
No, Orme realized that his place was not
on the sidewalk. By some means he must get
where he could discover what was going on in the
front flat on the third floor. Standing where he
now was, there was momentary danger of being
discovered by persons who would guess why he
was there. Maku might come.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>Orme looked to see who lived in &#8220;4a,&#8221; the flat
above the Japanese. The card bore the name:
</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Madame Alia, Clairvoyant and Trance Medium</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I think I will have my fortune told,&#8221; muttered
Orme, as he pressed Madame Alia&#8217;s bell and started
up the stairs.
</p>
<p>At the top of the second flight he looked to
the entrance of the front apartment. It had a
large square of ground glass, with the name
&#8220;Arima&#8221; in black letters. He continued upward
another flight and presently found himself before
two blank doors&mdash;one at the front and one a little
at one side. The side door opened slowly in response
to his knock.
</p>
<p>Before him stood a blowsy but not altogether
unprepossessing woman of middle years. She wore
a cheap print gown. A gipsy scarf was thrown
over her head and shoulders, and her ears held
loop earrings. Her inquiring glance at Orme
was not unmixed with suspicion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame Alia?&#8221; inquired Orme.
</p>
<p>She nodded and stood aside for him to enter. He
passed into a cheap little reception-hall which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
looked out on the street, and then, at her silent
direction went through a door at one side and
found himself in the medium&#8217;s sanctum.
</p>
<p>The one window gave on a dimly lighted narrow
space which apparently had been cut in from
the back of the building. Through the dusty glass
he could see the railing of a fire-escape platform,
and cutting diagonally across the light, part of
the stairs that led to the platform above. There
was a closed door, which apparently opened into
the outer hall. In the room were dirty red hangings,
two chairs, a couch, and a small square
center-table.
</p>
<p>Madame Alia had already seated herself at the
table and was shuffling a pack of cards. &#8220;Fifty-cent
reading?&#8221; she asked, as he took the chair
opposite her.
</p>
<p>Orme nodded. His thoughts were on the window
and the fire-escape, and he hardly heard her
monotonous sentences, though he obeyed mechanically
her instructions to cut and shuffle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are about to engage in a new business,&#8221;
she was saying. &#8220;You will be successful, but there
will be some trouble about a dark man.&mdash;Look
out for him.&mdash;He talks fair, but he means mischief.&mdash;There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
is a woman, too.&mdash;This man will try
to prejudice her against you.&#8221; And all the time
Orme was saying to himself, &#8220;How can I persuade
her to let me use the fire-escape?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly he was conscious that the woman had
ceased speaking and was running the cards
through her fingers and looking at him searchingly.
&#8220;You are not listening,&#8221; she said, as he met her
gaze.
</p>
<p>He smiled apologetically. &#8220;I know&mdash;I was preoccupied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help you if you don&#8217;t listen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme inferred that she took pride in her work.
He sighed and looked grave. &#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; he
said slowly, &#8220;that my case is too serious for the
cards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She brightened. &#8220;You&#8217;d ought to have a trance-reading&mdash;two
dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take any kind of reading that would help
me, but I&#8217;m afraid the situation is too difficult.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you come?&#8221; Again the look
of suspicion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came because you could help me, but not by
a reading.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Plainly she was frightened.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t put people away. That&#8217;s out of
my line. Honest!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look as if I wanted anything crooked
done?&#8221; Orme smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to tell what folks want,&#8221; she muttered.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a fly-cop, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The way you been sizing things up. You
aren&#8217;t going to do anything, are you? I pay
regular for my protection every month&mdash;five dollars&mdash;and
I work hard to get it, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme hesitated. He had known at the outset
that he was of a class different from the ordinary
run of her clients. The difference undoubtedly
had both puzzled and frightened her. He might
disabuse her of the notion that he had anything to
do with the police, but her misapprehension was
an advantage that he was loath to lose. Fearing
him, she might grant any favor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, listen to me,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mean you any harm, but I want you to answer a
few questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She eyed him furtively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the man in the flat below?&#8221; he
demanded.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Arima? No. He&#8217;s a Jap. I see him in
the halls sometimes, but I don&#8217;t do no more than
bow, like any neighbor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s noisy, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only when he has pupils. But he goes out
to do most of his teaching. Is he wanted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly. Now look here. I believe you&#8217;re
a well-meaning woman. Do you make a good
thing out of this business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair.&#8221; She smiled faintly. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t been in
Chicago long, and it takes time to work up a good
trade. I got a daughter to bring up. She&#8217;s with
friends. She don&#8217;t know anything about what I
do for a living.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Orme, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you
five dollars toward educating your girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took a bill from his pocket-book and handed
it to her. She accepted it with a deprecating
glance and a smile that was tinged with pathetic
coquetry. Then she looked at it strangely.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the writing?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Orme started. He had given her the marked
five-dollar bill. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to give you that
one,&#8221; he said, taking it from her fingers.
</p>
<p>She stared at him. &#8220;Is it phony?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but I want it. Here&#8217;s another.&#8221; As he
took a fresh bill from his pocket-book he discovered
to his surprise that the marked bill, together with
the few dollars in change he had received after
his purchase in the shop below, was all that he
now had left in his pocket. He remembered that
he had intended to draw on his funds that morning.
His departure from New York had been hurried,
and he had come away with little ready cash.
</p>
<p>Madame Alia slipped the bill into her bosom and
waited. She knew well enough that her visitor had
some demand to make.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Orme, &#8220;I am going to use your
fire-escape for a little while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to keep all visitors out,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t answer the bell. I may want to
come back this way quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is straight business, isn&#8217;t it? I don&#8217;t
want to get into no trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely straight,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;All you
have to do is to leave your window open and keep
quiet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can count on me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps
you know all about the place down there, but if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll tell you that the fire-escape leads
into his reception-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme smiled. &#8220;You seem to be acquainted with
your neighbor, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come up the stairs when his door was
open.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he seem to be pretty busy with his teaching?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Evenings, he is. And some come in the afternoon.
I always know, because they thud on the
floor so when they wrestle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And mornings?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He generally seems to be away mornings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy he&#8217;s what you&#8217;d call a noisy neighbor,&#8221;
said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind. There&#8217;s more or less noise
up here sometimes.&#8221; She smiled frankly. &#8220;Spirits
can make a lot of noise. I&#8217;ve known them to
throw tables over and drag chairs all around the
room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;&mdash;Orme was not interested in spirits&mdash;&#8220;be
sure you don&#8217;t let anybody in here until I
come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again she nodded. Then she went into the reception-hall
and he heard her push the bolt of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
the door. She did not return, but her steps seemed
to move into one of the other rooms.
</p>
<p>Orme went to the window, pushed it up, and
climbed out on the fire-escape. He was glad to see
that the wall across the court was windowless. He
might be observed from the buildings that backed
up from the next street, but they apparently belonged
to a large storage loft or factory. There
were no idle folk at the windows.
</p>
<p>The window of the room below was open. This
was in one sense an advantage&mdash;and Orme blessed
the Japanese athletes for their insistence on fresh
air; but on the other hand, it made quietness essential.
</p>
<p>Slowly he let himself through the opening in
the platform and moved a few steps down the
ladder. Then he crouched and peered through
the dingy lace curtains that were swaying in
the breeze.
</p>
<p>The interior was dim, but Orme succeeded in
distinguishing the furniture. There were straw
mats on the floor and several chairs stood about.
At the opposite side of the room was a closed
door. From his knowledge of Madame Alia&#8217;s
apartment, Orme knew that this door opened into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the hall of the building, and the square of ground
glass, with its reversed letters of the athlete&#8217;s
name, told him that it was used as the chief entrance.
Madame Alia preferred her clients to enter
into another room.
</p>
<p>In the farther corner of the interior Orme saw
a large square table. It was covered with a red
print cloth, which hung over the edge, nearly to
the floor. If he could reach that table and conceal
himself beneath it, his position would be
better.
</p>
<p>And now he suddenly remembered that the outline
of his head would be visible against the outer
light to anyone within. The room seemed to be
empty, but&mdash;at that instant he heard a door open.
He drew his head up. Someone was moving about
the room.
</p>
<p>The steps went here and there. Chairs were
shifted, to judge from the sound. But evidently
there was only one person, for Orme could hear
no voices. He decided that Arima was preparing
for visitors.
</p>
<p>Again he heard a door open and close. Had
Arima gone out, or had some other person entered?
Orme waited a moment, listening; no sound came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
from within. He lowered his head and peered.
The room was empty.
</p>
<p>Arima might return at any moment, but the
chance had to be taken. Quickly, silently, Orme
descended to the platform, slid over the sill, and
tip-toed over to the table. Another instant and
he was under the cover.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>&#8220;FIND THE AMERICAN&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>As Orme let the table-cover fall back to its normal
position and turned to get himself into a
comfortable attitude, his hand touched something
soft and yielding. For a moment he was startled,
but the sound of a throaty purr, and the realization
that his hand was resting on fur soon told
him that his companion in hiding was a cat.
</p>
<p>He wondered whether the Japanese liked pets.
From what little he knew of Japanese character
it did not seem to him consistent that they should
care for animals. Yet here was a peaceful tabby.
</p>
<p>In order to accommodate himself to his close
quarters, Orme had to double his legs back, resting
on his thigh and supporting the upper part
of his body with one hand. The cat settled down
against his knee.
</p>
<p>The light filtered redly through the table-cover.
To his satisfaction he found a small hole, evidently
a burn made by some careless smoker.
Through this aperture he could look out. His
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
range of vision included the greater part of the
room, excepting the side on which the table stood.
He could see the window and several chairs, as
well as the door into the adjoining room, but the
door into the hall was out of view, at his right.
</p>
<p>While he was looking about, a man came from
the next room. Doubtless it was Arima; at least
Orme recognized the Japanese who had overcome
him in the porter&#8217;s office at the Père Marquette
the night before. He stepped into the room with a
little smile on his brown face. Seating himself in
a chair, he fixed his heels in the rungs and clasped
his hands about his knees. He was waiting.
</p>
<p>The black eyes rested on the table. To Orme
they seemed to be boring through the cover that
concealed him, and he hardly dared to breathe,
but the Asiatic appeared to observe nothing unusual.
Orme wondered at the unfathomable intelligence
of those eyes. He had often said of the
Chinese and Japanese that he did not trust them
for the reason that a Caucasian could never tell
what they were thinking about. The racial difference
in thought processes he found disconcerting.
</p>
<p>A bell rang. Arima went to the door, out of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
view, and opened it. Orme could hear persons
mounting the stairs, and presently the voice of
Arima said, &#8220;Come in,&#8221; and the visitors entered the
room.
</p>
<p>Pausing near the door for a moment, they exchanged
a few whispered sentences. Then one of
them walked over toward the window. Orme repressed
an exclamation, for the figure that came
into view was the figure of Poritol&mdash;dapper, assertive.
</p>
<p>He was dressed as on the night before, and his
precious high hat was hugged close to his shoulder.
</p>
<p>His eyes roved with an exaggerated assumption
of important cunning. Presently he threw over
his shoulder a rapid sentence in a foreign tongue.
It sounded like Spanish, and Orme inferred that it
was a dialect of Portuguese.
</p>
<p>The answer came from an oily tongue; the voice
was Alcatrante&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>What were the South Americans doing here?
It was only a few hours since the Japanese had set
on Alcatrante, yet here he was in a stronghold of
the enemy&mdash;and expected! Had the astute diplomat
fallen into a trap?
</p>
<p>Arima was standing, not far from Poritol. His
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
face was expressionless. Looking from Alcatrante
to Poritol and back again, he said in English:
&#8220;The mos&#8217; honorable gentleman will soon be here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right,&#8221; said Alcatrante suavely.
&#8220;Mention no names.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Arima nodded slightly.
</p>
<p>The silence grew intense. Orme was relieved
when it was broken by another ring of the bell,
and Arima slipped to the door. Alcatrante moved
over beside Poritol and whispered a few words,
scarcely moving his lips. His face looked yellow
by daylight, and the eyes behind the gold spectacles
were heavy-lidded and almost closed. Orme
inferred that the night had been sleepless for Alcatrante.
</p>
<p>These observations were interrupted by the
entrance of the newcomer. He paused at the
threshold, evidently to salute, for Poritol and Alcatrante
bowed low. Then quick steps crossed the
floor and into view came a nervous but assured-looking
little figure&mdash;a Japanese, but undoubtedly
a man of great dignity. His manner of sharp
authority would be hard to dispute, for it was
supported by a personality that seemed to be
stronger than Alcatrante&#8217;s. Who he was Orme
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
could not guess, but that he was somebody of importance
it was easy to see.
</p>
<p>The stranger bowed again and addressed himself
to Alcatrante. The conversation was carried on
in French.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well that you communicated with me, sir,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;we were working at cross-purposes when,
in reality, our interests were identical.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante bowed. &#8220;I came to that conclusion
late last night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I do not deny that it
would have pleased me to carry the affair through
by myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, your position would then have been
stronger.&#8221; The Japanese smiled faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; continued Alcatrante, with a slight
grimace, &#8220;the activity of your men made that impossible.
I have no lieutenants such as yours.&#8221;
He shot an ugly gleam at Poritol, whose sudden
assumption of fearsome humility was in strange
contrast to his usual self-assurance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As we hold the documents&#8221;&mdash;the Japanese
spoke with great distinctness&mdash;&#8220;you will necessarily
admit our advantage. That means, you will
understand, a smaller commission on the next contract.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>Alcatrante twisted his face into the semblance
of a smile. &#8220;Not too small, or we cannot undertake
the work,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not too small,&#8221; the stranger agreed
calmly, &#8220;but smaller than the last. You must not
forget that there are others who would gladly do
the same work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but at best they cannot get the terms we
get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly. That is a matter still to be determined.
Meantime we have assumed that our interests
in this document are identical. Let us
test it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One word first,&#8221; said Alcatrante. &#8220;I take it
that, if our interests are sympathetic with yours,
we may count on your protection?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most assuredly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shall see. My fairness is clear in
that I give you a sight of the document with myself.
I might have denied all knowledge of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante smiled as if to say: &#8220;I already knew
so much that you could not risk that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger turned to Arima and said something
in Japanese. Arima replied, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
stranger explained to Alcatrante: &#8220;I asked about
my man Maku. The American struck him on the
head last night, and injured him. But he is recovering.
He is troublesome&mdash;that American.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme started. His head bumped against the
table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; exclaimed Poritol, advancing.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something under that table!&#8221; He
stooped to lift the cover.
</p>
<p>One chance flashed into Orme&#8217;s mind. Quickly
he seized the cat, which was still sleeping against
his knee, and pushed it under the table-cover. It
walked out into the room, mewing plaintively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A cat,&#8221; said Poritol, drawing back.
</p>
<p>Arima explained in English: &#8220;It belongs to
lady upstairs. Comes down fire-escape. Shoo!
Shoo!&#8221; He clapped his hands and the animal
bounded to the window-sill and disappeared up
the iron steps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; began the stranger, &#8220;shall we examine
the documents?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; said Alcatrante. &#8220;I should
first like a clear understanding with you&mdash;some
words in private.&#8221; He moved to a corner, and
there the stranger joined him. They talked in an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
undertone for several minutes, Alcatrante gesturing
volubly, the stranger nodding now and then,
and interjecting a few brief words.
</p>
<p>What was going on was more than ever a mystery
to Orme. The stranger&#8217;s reference to &#8220;the
next contract&#8221; strengthened the surmise that the
documents in the envelope were connected with
a South American trade concession. Alcatrante
had plainly concluded that his interests and those
of the Japanese were identical. He must have communicated
with the strange Japanese the first
thing in the morning. That would account for
his failure to call at the Père Marquette at ten
o&#8217;clock. Learning that the bill had been taken
from Orme, and that the coveted documents were
in the possession of the Japanese, he had no
object in keeping his appointment. As for Poritol,
he had become a figure of minor importance.
</p>
<p>But Orme did not let these questions long engage
him, for he had made a discovery. Where
his head bumped against the table, the board
above him&mdash;solid, as he had supposed&mdash;rattled
strangely. At the moment he could not investigate,
but as soon as the cat had satisfied the
suspicions of Poritol, and Alcatrante and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
stranger had retired to their corner, he twisted his
head back and examined the wood above him.
</p>
<p>The table had a drawer. From the room outside
this drawer was concealed by the cloth cover,
and Orme had not suspected its existence.
</p>
<p>Now, the table was cheaply made. The drawer
was shallow and narrow, and it was held in position,
under the table, by an open framework of
wood. When it was pushed in, it was stopped at
the right place by two cleats; there was no solid
strip to prevent its being pushed in too far.
</p>
<p>Orme put his hand to the back of the drawer.
There was a space between it and the table-top.
</p>
<p>Cautiously he pushed his hand through the
opening. His fingers touched a flat object&mdash;a pad
of paper, or&mdash;the thought made his heart beat&mdash;a
large, thick envelope. Could Arima have used
the drawer as a hiding-place?
</p>
<p>Slowly he got the edge of the object between
his first and second fingers and drew it a little
way toward the back of the drawer. A moment
later he had it under his eyes.
</p>
<p>Yes, it was a long envelope of heavy linen, and
there were bulky papers within. The gummed
flap was toward him. He was interested to note
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
that, important though the documents seemed to
be, the envelope was not sealed with wax.
</p>
<p>He remembered what the girl had said: her
father&#8217;s name was written on the address side. He
had only to turn it over to learn who she was. In
the circumstances such an act might be justified.
But she had not wished him to know&mdash;and he would
even now respect her wish and keep his own promise
to her.
</p>
<p>His first thought was to slip the envelope into
his pocket, but it occurred to him in time that, if
it did indeed contain the documents concerning
which Alcatrante and the stranger were disputing,
it would be sought and missed long before he could
escape from the room. So, taking a pencil from
his pocket, he inserted it under the corner of
the flap and slowly worked the flap free. The
strength of the linen prevented any tearing.
</p>
<p>He removed the contents of the envelope&mdash;two
folded sheets of parchment paper, held together by
an elastic band&mdash;and thrust them into the inside
pocket of his coat. All this was done swiftly and
noiselessly.
</p>
<p>It now remained to find something to take the
place of the abstracted documents. In his pocket
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
were some printed prospectuses of the mine which
he had come to Chicago to investigate. In shape
and thickness they were not dissimilar to the documents
which he had taken. He slipped the prospectuses
into the envelope and, wetting his finger,
rubbed it along the gummed surface of the flap.
Enough glue remained to make the flap adhere,
after a little pressure. The job was by no means
perfect, but it was not likely to be detected.
</p>
<p>At that moment Alcatrante raised his voice and
said, still in French: &#8220;You are sure, then, that
this will not only delay the game, but end it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite sure,&#8221; said the Japanese. &#8220;Unless the
documents are signed before midnight to-night
nothing can be done for sometime. We have the
Germans fixed. They will do what they have thus
far agreed to do, but if any technical hitch arises,
such as a failure to sign within the time-limit, they
will decline to renew negotiations. That was all
we could get from them, but it is enough&mdash;now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And for other ships,&#8221; said Alcatrante, &#8220;the
commission shall be five hundred thousand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred thousand. Seven hundred and
fifty was too much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred thousand in gold.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In gold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme slipped the envelope back into the drawer
and put his eye to the hole in the cover. His position
was now more and more critical, for to open
the drawer and get the envelope, Arima would have
to lift the table cover.
</p>
<p>The stranger turned to Arima. &#8220;Give us the envelope,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>Arima approached the table. Orme crowded
back against the wall as far as he could, knowing
that the chances of escaping discovery were
strongly against him. But he was saved by the
very eagerness of the others. They all crowded
about Arima, as he lifted the cover, opened the
drawer, and took out the envelope. So close did
they stand that Orme was out of their angle of
vision. The table-cover fell again, and he was
safe. He resumed his position at the peep-hole.
</p>
<p>The stranger stepped to the middle of the room,
the others gathering around him. With a quick
jerk he tore the envelope open, and taking out the
papers, ran his eye over them rapidly. He uttered
an exclamation. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Alcatrante.
The South American&#8217;s hand was shaking,
and perspiration stood out on his forehead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>The Japanese snarled. &#8220;Tricked! They&#8217;ve
fooled us. That honorable burglar of yours got
the wrong envelope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante snatched the papers. &#8220;&#8216;Prospectus,&#8217;&#8221;
he read, &#8220;&#8216;of the Last Dare Mining Company.&#8217;
But I do not understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Japanese glared at him angrily. &#8220;If you
had kept out of this business,&#8221; he snapped, &#8220;and
let Maku attend to it, everything would have been
right. Now your burglars have spoiled it.&#8221; He
snatched back the harmless prospectuses and tore
them in two, throwing the fragments to the floor
and grinding them under his heel.
</p>
<p>Arima spoke. &#8220;Pardon, honorable sir, Maku
say the right envelope was taken from the safe.
Maku know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! Then it was you who were tricked&mdash;outwitted.
That American reached the tree before
you last evening and substituted these papers.
Go back to Japan, Arima. I don&#8217;t need you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Arima bowed submissively. As for the stranger,
his rage gave way to despair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I say to the Emperor?&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;What shall I say to the Emperor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then his feelings came again under control; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
looked calmly at Alcatrante. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;what would you suggest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante&#8217;s face was a puzzle. Every shade of
doubt, disappointment, anger, suspicion, and
shrewd deduction passed over it. He was putting
into play that marvelous power of concentration
on subtle issues that had enabled him to play so
brilliantly the rôle of international under-dog. At
last he smiled and spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Find the American,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a knock at the door. Arima
looked at his master, who nodded indifferently and
said: &#8220;Yes, see who it is. It can do no harm
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme heard the door open. What startled him
first was the action of Poritol, who stepped back
to the wall, his jaw dropping, his face a picture of
embarrassment and fright. Alcatrante and the
stranger showed amazement.
</p>
<p>For a moment they stood thus in silence, and
then from the door came a clear voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What? You here, Mr. Alcatrante? And
the Japanese minister?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme almost sprang from his hiding-place. The
voice was the voice of the girl!
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE WAY OUT</h3>
</div>

<p>The sound of the girl&#8217;s voice brought the men in
the room to life. Her words were shaded to a tone
of fearless scorn which must have bitten deep, for
Alcatrante and the Japanese minister looked like
school-boys caught in wrong-doing. The South
American gnawed at his lip; the Japanese looked
at the floor, and Orme now realized that the manner
which had seemed so indicative of a masterful
personality was the manner which springs from
power&mdash;the manner that is built upon the assurance
of a tremendous backing.
</p>
<p>The tension was broken by Poritol. The little
man&#8217;s dismay suddenly gave way to an eager and
voluble excitement, and he rushed across the room,
exclaiming: &#8220;Oh, my dear miss&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No names,&#8221; commanded Alcatrante harshly,
turning on his subordinate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear young lady,&#8221; continued Poritol
breathlessly, &#8220;I am the victim of your misunderstanding.
You will permit me to explain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>She answered with an even, cutting edge in her
voice: &#8220;You cannot explain, Mr. Poritol.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, blind to her meaning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care to hear you,&#8221; she said; and
Poritol slunk back to his former position. From
his face it was clear that he had no desire except
to get away.
</p>
<p>Meantime Alcatrante aroused himself. &#8220;My
friend here&#8221;&mdash;he indicated the Japanese&mdash;&#8220;and
myself are here on business which concerns our two
nations. Your appearance, I presume, is due to
a desire to engage the professional services of Mr.
Arima. Or perhaps you were trying to find the
fortune-teller upstairs.&#8221; He barely repressed his
sneer.
</p>
<p>The girl did not answer. She had remained by
the door, and but for the attitudes of the others,
Orme would not have known but that she had gone.
As it was, he could read in their bearing the disconcerting
effects of her continued disdain.
</p>
<p>The Japanese spoke. &#8220;Will you enter, miss,
or shall we direct you on your way? Arima will
come out and talk with you, if you so wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still no answer. To Orme, in his hiding, there
was something uncanny in her failure to respond.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
But he could picture her&mdash;Truth, calm in the
presence of subterfuge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not state your desire?&#8221; Again the
Japanese. He was smiling now, with the false
politeness of his race.
</p>
<p>And then she spoke: &#8220;That envelope on the
floor was stolen from my father&#8217;s home. It bears
my father&#8217;s name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before Alcatrante could stop him, little Poritol,
with some vague hope of making amends, had
snatched up the torn envelope and taken it to her.
He returned to the range of Orme&#8217;s vision with
an air of virtuous importance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The contents,&#8221; said the girl&mdash;&#8220;where are the
papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante and the Japanese looked at each
other. It was as if they said, &#8220;In view of our
failure we might as well make a clean breast of it.&#8221;
But Alcatrante was too cunning to take the initiative
in confession. He left that to the Japanese,
who spoke unhesitatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only papers in the envelope were these.&#8221;
He picked up the torn prospectuses from the floor
and held them extended in his hand. &#8220;Our surprise
is as great as yours.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect me to believe that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you believe it or not, my dear young
lady, it is true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, then the Japanese
continued: &#8220;We have reason to think that
the envelope was for a time last night in the possession
of an American, and that he substituted
these circulars for whatever the envelope may have
held.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme&#8217;s impulse to declare himself was almost irresistible.
A man whose instincts were less cautious
would have thrown the table over and ranged
himself beside the girl. Orme was not fearful, but
he knew that the chances of a successful outcome
would be lessened by exposure. Even if he and the
girl got safely from the room, there would be a
pursuit, and the risk of losing the papers would
be great.
</p>
<p>As for the girl, she clearly was in no danger.
These men would not harm her.
</p>
<p>But would the assertion of the Japanese lead her
to doubt Orme? Would she believe that he had
actually recovered the papers the night before and
kept them for his own purposes? He remembered
that he had given her only the scantiest account of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
his adventure at the tree, for he had wished to
spare her the details of an incident that meant her
disappointment as well as his own. She might
now readily attribute his reticence to a desire to
conceal something.
</p>
<p>And then came her voice. Her first words
brought a glow to Orme&#8217;s heart: &#8220;I know that
you are mistaken. No American has those
papers.&#8221; Orme breathed his relief. Then she
added the dubious word&mdash;&#8220;Unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>So she did doubt him after all. Well, he could
not blame her. The scene in the room&mdash;the frankness
of the Japanese, which could only be attributed
to discomfiture; the empty envelope; the
torn prospectuses on the floor, all these conditions
pointed to the truth of the explanation she had
heard.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there was his appearance on
the lake, an hour or more after the episode on the
campus. Might it not occur to her that, had he
already secured the papers, he would have had no
object in the further pursuit of the Japanese?
But, perhaps she would think that he was seeking
Arima to sell the papers back to him; or that,
in spite of his appearance of surprise, he had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
a witness of her abduction and had gone out on
the water to save her. There were so many things
she might think! Indeed, that dubious word &#8220;unless&#8221;
might even signify, &#8220;unless he has secured
the papers since I last saw him.&#8221; But no; she
would gather from the situation in which she found
her enemies that the envelope had not been out of
their possession since it was taken from the tree.
Orme shut his lips together hard. Her doubt of
him would have to be endured, even though it
shattered his pleasant dream of her complete and
sympathetic understanding.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante, meantime, was studying the girl
with curious eyes. His look was both perplexed
and admiring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind telling me how you happened
to come to this place?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>She answered indifferently: &#8220;Supposing that
the Japanese had stolen the papers, I searched Maku&#8217;s
room at our house. There was a torn envelope
there, with the name &#8216;Arima&#8217; printed in
the corner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante bowed. &#8220;You are cleverer than most
Americans, my dear young lady,&#8221; he said. His
lips curved into a smile that disclosed his fangs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;is as it may be. But I
have not your admiration for trickery, Mr. Alcatrante.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again he smiled. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;trickery
is the detail work of diplomacy.&#8221; Then with
a shade of seriousness in his voice, he asked: &#8220;Why
did you use that word &#8216;unless&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, indeed?&#8221; She made this noncommittal
answer, and if Alcatrante had hoped to soothe
her into friendliness and draw from her a clue to
her suspicions, he was disappointed.
</p>
<p>There was another period of silence, broken at
last by the Japanese. &#8220;The fact that we have
failed, my dear young lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;makes concealment
unnecessary. I know, of course, that
this matter will never become public. You understand
that the representatives of great nations
often have to take steps which, as private citizens,
they would never think of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I understand. There
is no more to be said. Good-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a step and the sound of the door closing.
She had gone.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante and the Japanese looked at each
other. &#8220;We have not failed&mdash;yet,&#8221; said Alcatrante
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
in French. &#8220;The girl does not know where
the documents are, or she would not have come
here. If her father does not have them before
midnight our plans are safe. We remain merely
at a loss as to the details of the documents, and we
already know what they contain in a general way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the Japanese, &#8220;things do not
look so black, perhaps. But I am interested in
your former advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Find the American! That is what <i>she</i> will try
to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had an appointment with him this morning,&#8221;
said Alcatrante grimly, &#8220;but when you said
that your man had the envelope, it no longer
seemed necessary to go. We&mdash;you and I&mdash;still have
the same object in view. I suggest that we now
set out separately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you wish,&#8221; said the Japanese calmly.
Doubtless he knew that Alcatrante was grasping
at a straw which might still give him the advantage
in future negotiations. &#8220;I am honored by your
co-operation thus far.&#8221; He bowed formally.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante returned the bow and, beckoning to
Poritol, left the room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>The Japanese minister turned to Arima and
talked rapidly in his native tongue. From his
manner it was plain that he was giving orders. At
last, with a little gesture of authority, he put on
his hat and walked out. The door closed after
him with a slam.
</p>
<p>Arima, now alone, seated himself in a chair and
appeared to meditate. Again his hands were
clasped about his knees and his beady eyes fixed on
space. For fully fifteen minutes he sat thus; then,
with a little clucking sound, he leaped to his feet
and hurried into the next room.
</p>
<p>Now was Orme&#8217;s chance. He lifted the table-cover
and rose to his feet. Arima had not closed
the door after him, but Orme was not in the line
of direct view into the other room, and he had to
risk the possibility of being seen before he reached
the window.
</p>
<p>Or should he try for the door? It all depended
upon what part of the next room Arima was in;
but the window seemed safer, for the opening and
closing of the door would be sure to attract attention.
</p>
<p>Orme moved toward the window slowly, watching
the opening through which Arima had disappeared.
He got half-way to the window; three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
more steps would bring him to the sill. And then,
without warning, Arima leaped into the room.
Even in that moment Orme caught a glimpse of a
mirror in the farther room, and knew that the Japanese
had seen his reflection.
</p>
<p>At this instant another man appeared, close behind
Arima. A bandage was wrapped around his
head. It was Maku, who presumably had been in
the apartment all the time.
</p>
<p>Orme stood little chance of overcoming the two.
Quick as cats, with muscles like steel springs and
a great variety of scientific tricks of offense and
defense, they could handle him as they willed in a
direct encounter. If Orme had had a revolver, he
would now have drawn it. Yet he knew that this
was not a case for fire-arms. Obviously, if he used
a dangerous weapon in these men&#8217;s rooms and was
afterward caught, it would fare hard with him, for
the real facts would be suppressed and he would be
sentenced as an ordinary housebreaker, perhaps
with some clemency due to his personal standing.
</p>
<p>A quick intuition told him that he would not
escape lightly if they fairly got their hands on
him. The two Japanese had hitherto shown much
patience with him. Their desire seemed to have
been to avoid hurting him any more than was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
necessary. But there is a limit to Japanese patience.
The scathing words of the Japanese minister
must still be burning in Arima&#8217;s brain. And
Maku, who had controlled himself while Orme was
following him through the streets of the North
Side, no longer had a diplomatic reason for restraining
his rage against the man who had struck
him down. In any event, the eyes of Arima and
Maku glittered angrily, and Orme realized that he
could expect no mercy.
</p>
<p>He caught up a chair and raised it over his head,
prepared to bring it down on Arima, who was only
a few feet from him and coming fast.
</p>
<p>The Japanese raised his arms, to fend the expected
blow. With sudden inspiration, Orme hurled
the chair at his opponent&#8217;s feet. There was a
crash. Arima sprawled headlong. Maku, who
was close behind, tried to leap over Arima, but his
feet went through the rungs of the chair, and he,
too, crashed to the floor.
</p>
<p>As he threw the chair Orme leaped back. Before
the Japanese could get out of their tangle, he
had jumped over the window-sill and was running
up the fire-escape. Madame Alia, was at her window,
a look of startled inquiry on her face. She
stepped back as he crowded into the room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be after me.
Hide me somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; She took his sleeve and pulled him
to a corner. There she pushed aside the dingy
hanging and Orme saw that the wall was covered
with a wainscoting that ran from floor to ceiling.
</p>
<p>The medium looked at him with bright eyes.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the real sort,&#8221; she whispered, and a wave
of color in her cheeks brought back the suggestion
of girlish beauty. &#8220;I saw that scrap there
through a hole in the floor. You&#8217;re the goods.&#8221;
She pressed his arm almost affectionately, then,
with her free hand, she pushed against the paneling.
Noiselessly a section of it turned inward,
disclosing a dark cavity. &#8220;Get in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme quickly slipped into the darkness, the
panel closed, and he heard the swish of the hanging
as it dropped back against the board.
</p>
<p>It was not too soon. Two soft thuds told him
that the Japanese had dropped over the sill into
the room.
</p>
<p>He heard the woman give a well-feigned scream
of surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse us, miss,&#8221;&mdash;it was Arima&#8217;s voice&mdash;&#8220;we
looking for sneak thief. He come in here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be off with you. I&#8217;ve just come from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
front room there, and there wasn&#8217;t a soul came
in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have gone out to the hall, then.&#8221;
The woman&#8217;s voice had a note of mollification&mdash;as
though she had suddenly recognized the right of
the two Japanese to enter the apartment. &#8220;<i>I</i>
didn&#8217;t hear him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few words of Japanese colloquy; then Arima:
&#8220;I look around. My friend go to hall.&#8221; A door
closed; evidently Maku had gone out; and then
Orme heard steps. After this there was a long
wait, while the Japanese examined the other rooms,
the woman evidently offering him her aid. At last
they returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I go back,&#8221; said Arima. &#8220;I saw him
come in the window. My friend will know. See
you later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Presently the woman raised the hanging and
whispered through the boards: &#8220;He went back
down the fire-escape. His friend&#8217;s in the hall.
He&#8217;ll find out you haven&#8217;t went down, and then he&#8217;ll
come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try the roof,&#8221; whispered Orme. &#8220;Perhaps
I can get on to another house that way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I see.&#8221; She walked away, but soon
returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; he heard her say. &#8220;That Jap&#8217;s a
sitting on the fire-escape watching. He grinned
when I looked down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme pondered. &#8220;Help me out of this,&#8221; he
whispered, &#8220;and there&#8217;ll be something in it for
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She moved impatiently. &#8220;Cut it out! I don&#8217;t
want nothing. You&#8217;re a good sport, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
She paused. &#8220;Not that I&#8217;d mind having a present.
But I don&#8217;t want no money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme caught the distinction. &#8220;I&#8217;ll remember,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;And what shall I do now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to stay in there a while, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I simply must get away&mdash;and within an hour
or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll manage that,&#8221; she answered confidently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see. Just leave it to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme smiled to himself, there in the darkness.
Of course, he would leave it to her; but he did
not see how she was to rid him of the watchful
Japanese.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just one thing,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
is done, will have to be done without help
from outside. This is not a matter for the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. Why can&#8217;t you just leave it
to me? I don&#8217;t believe you trust me a little bit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I am absolutely
in your hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He heard her sigh faintly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
put down the window now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t
safe for me to stand here talking to you unless
I do. That Arima fellow might pop up the fire-escape
any time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was back in a few moments. He had heard
the window creak down, and had wondered whether
the action would add to Arima&#8217;s suspicion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he comes up now,&#8221; she explained in an undertone,
&#8220;the glare on the outside of the window
will keep him from seeing in very plain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that she did not speak for some time, but
the occasional movements of her body, as she
leaned against the panel, were audible to Orme.
He found himself wondering about her&mdash;how she
had happened to take up the career of fortune-telling.
She must have been a handsome woman;
even now she was not unattractive.
</p>
<p>The delay grew more and more irksome. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
seemed to Orme as though he had been behind the
panel for hours. After a while he asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About two o&#8217;clock. Ain&#8217;t you hungry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme laughed softly. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute.&#8221; She moved away. When
she returned she pulled up the hanging and opened
the panel. In her hand was a thick sandwich.
&#8220;I was just going to eat my own lunch when you
came back through the window,&#8221; she explained.
</p>
<p>He took the sandwich. She looked at him
boldly. He was standing close to her in the opening.
There was an expression that was almost
defiant in her eyes. &#8220;I&mdash;I want my present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall have it, Madame Alia,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t my kind&mdash;and it won&#8217;t make no difference
to you.&#8221; Her voice faltered and her eyes
dropped. &#8220;I want you to kiss me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme looked at her, and understood. He put
his arms around her and kissed her gently on the
lips. There was no disloyalty in it. He was simply
satisfying the craving of this poor woman&#8217;s
soul&mdash;a craving for a tribute to which she could
always revert as the symbol of a high friendliness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
She felt that he was of a different world; he knew
that the world was all one, though partitioned off
by artificial barriers, but he could not correct her
view.
</p>
<p>She clung to him for a moment after his lips left
hers, then released herself from his clasp and
moved back into the room, her face averted. Was
it to hide a blush? Orme did not ask himself, but
respecting her reticence of spirit, silently closed the
panel and was again in darkness.
</p>
<p>For a time he stood there quietly. His back
was against the wall,&mdash;his hands easily touched
the paneling that shut him off from the room. He
wondered what this secret place was for, and taking
a match from his pocket, he lighted it.
</p>
<p>The enclosure seemed to extend all the way
across the side of the room. Farther along, lying
on the floor and standing against the wall, were
contrivances of which at first he could make nothing&mdash;poles,
pieces of tin, and&mdash;were those masks,
heaped in the corner? From a row of pegs hung
long robes&mdash;white and black.
</p>
<p>The truth flashed into Orme&#8217;s mind. He was in
Madame Alia&#8217;s ghost-closet!
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>POWER OF DARKNESS</h3>
</div>

<p>To Orme the next half-hour was very long. He
seated himself upon the floor of the closet and ate
the sandwich which the clairvoyant had brought
him. Occasionally he could hear her moving about
the apartment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor charlatan!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;She is herself
a &#8216;good sort.&#8217; I suppose she excuses the
sham of her profession on the ground that it deceives
many persons into happiness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He struck another match and looked again at
the ghostly paraphernalia about him. Near him
hung a black robe with a large hood. He crushed
one of the folds in his hands and was surprised to
discover how thin it was and into how small space
it could be compressed. Not far away stood several
pairs of large slippers of soft black felt. The
white robes were also of thinnest gossamer&mdash;flimsy
stuff that swayed like smoke when he breathed
toward it.
</p>
<p>By the light of a third match he looked more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
carefully at the other apparatus. There was a
large pair of angel-wings, of the conventional
shape. The assortment of masks was sufficiently
varied for the representation of many types of
men and women of different ages.
</p>
<p>The match burned down to his fingers, and again
he sat in darkness, wondering at the elaborateness
of the medium&#8217;s outfit. She was a fraud, but he
liked her&mdash;yes, pitied her&mdash;and he felt inclined to
excuse in so far as he could. For the kiss which
he had given her he felt no regret; it was hers, in
all innocence, for what of good she might have
found in it.
</p>
<p>The minutes dragged by. He thought of the
precious documents, safe in the inside pocket of
his coat. What they were, he did not try to determine,
but it was plain that they must be of international
importance. The talk of ships and Alcatrante&#8217;s
references to commissions had puzzled
him. But suddenly came to his mind the newspaper
rumors that Japan was secretly adding vessels
to her navy through the agency of a South
American republic which was having cruisers and
battle-ships built in Europe, to turn them over at
their completion, to the Japanese. There was, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
yet, no international proof of this policy, for none
of the ships had been completed, but the South
American country was certainly adopting a policy
of naval construction quite out of proportion to
her position among the Powers.
</p>
<p>How came the girl to be involved in this mix-up
of nations? Through her father, of course&mdash;but
who was he? A concessionaire? Her courage
and determination, employed against shrewd men,
was as notable as the beauty of her face and mind,
for she was like a queen in her assured comprehension.
</p>
<p>How it quickened his heart to think of her! The
poor, faded medium, with the smolder of old flames
in her eyes, with the records of hard experience
written on her face, was a child in stature beside
the girl&mdash;a child with yearnings that could never
be satisfied.
</p>
<p>Well, the girl had doubted him. He could not
wonder at that, for the facts were all against him,
and she had known him only for a few hours. Yet
he had hoped&mdash;he had believed&mdash;that she would
know the truth and the devotion in him without
further evidence. Perhaps he had expected too
much from her noble insight. After all&mdash;and that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
was part of the loveliness of her&mdash;she was a very
human girl.
</p>
<p>The panel swung open, and Madame Alia stood
looking down at him. She spoke in an undertone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Japs are still watching. Arima is sitting
on the fire-escape by his window, and I can hear
the other fellow moving around in the hall outside
my door. I think they&#8217;re on to your being here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme thought for a minute. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get
away soon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind telling you
that there are papers that must be delivered before
twelve o&#8217;clock to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I take them for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where to tell you to take them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sighed. &#8220;I guess you don&#8217;t trust me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust you? Of course, I do. But the truth
is, Madame Alia, that it is going to need hard
work on my part to find the person to whom the
papers belong. I don&#8217;t even know his name.&#8221;
Secretly he condemned himself now, because he had
not overcome his scruples and looked at the address
on the envelope while he had the chance.
</p>
<p>Again she sighed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;of
course, it&#8217;s beyond me. Do you&mdash;do you mind my
knowing <i>your</i> name?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize that
you didn&#8217;t know it already. My name is Robert
Orme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at him with a smile. &#8220;Well, Mr.
Orme, I&#8217;ll get you out of this. I think I know a
way. But you&#8217;ll have to do just what I tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I depend on you,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>She laid her hand on his shoulder with a friendly
pressure. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to wait in here a while
longer&mdash;and you&#8217;ll have to keep mighty quiet.
I&#8217;ve got a circle at three o&#8217;clock&mdash;a séance. They
come once a week, and I can&#8217;t well put them off.
You see, I work alone. It&#8217;s a small circle, and I
never liked the idea of helpers; they&#8217;re likely to
give you away sooner or later. I stretch a curtain
across this corner for a cabinet, and they tie me
to a chair&mdash;and then things happen.&#8221; She
smiled faintly. &#8220;I know <i>you</i> won&#8217;t hurt my
game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All your secrets are safe with me.&#8221; He
glanced at the dark interior of the closet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know any other place to put you,&#8221; she
said simply. &#8220;They&#8217;d have got you, if you had
went to the hall&mdash;Sh-h!&#8221; The panel closed and
she was away. A moment later he heard her talking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
with Arima, who apparently had again climbed
up to her window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thief must be here,&#8221; said Arima. &#8220;He not
been in hall. My friend know. We see him come
in here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you he wasn&#8217;t here. If you don&#8217;t believe
me, why don&#8217;t you call the cops.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We not want cops. I come in and watch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m going to hold a circle here in a few
minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Arima&#8217;s voice had a puzzled note.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A séance. The spirits come. You know.
All sit around, with the light turned down, and
spirits come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; The Japanese either understood or pretended
to. &#8220;I come, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a period of hesitation the woman said:
&#8220;Why, yes, I guess you can&mdash;if you keep still.
Your friend can come, too. You&#8217;re a neighbor,
and I won&#8217;t charge you anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I call my friend.&#8221; Footsteps
crossed the room and the door to the hall was
opened. Presently it closed again, and Orme
heard fragments of a conversation in Japanese.
</p>
<p>From other sounds Orme gathered that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
woman was arranging chairs. &#8220;Sit here, you
two,&#8221; he heard her say. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to keep
quiet when the rest come. Do just what they do?
Be sure, now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The bell now began to ring at frequent intervals,
each time announcing the arrival of newcomers.
Madame Alia&#8217;s clients were quickly assembling;
Orme could hear them whispering
among themselves.
</p>
<p>A clinking noise he did not at first understand.
Then he realized that it was the sound of silver
dropping into a hat. Someone was taking up the
collection. He knew, too, when they hung the
curtain across his corner of the room, shutting off
the space in which the medium was to sit, and
when they lighted the gas and drew down the
shades at the window. Then he heard them lead
her into the cabinet and tie her to the chair.
</p>
<p>The silence that followed these preparations
grew oppressive. The clients were waiting for
the right &#8220;current,&#8221; and Madame Alia, Orme had
no doubt, was using the interval to free herself
from her bonds.
</p>
<p>In a little while someone started the hymn,
&#8220;Over the River They Beckon to Me,&#8221; and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
others took it up&mdash;women&#8217;s voices, chiefly, struggling
through the melody in their trebles, with the
mumbled undertones of one or two men.
</p>
<p>A draught of cooler air struck Orme&#8217;s cheek; a
hand found his shoulder; a voice whispered. Under
cover of the singing Madame Alia had opened
the panel. Her lips were close to his ear. In the
creepy tension of the waiting Orme had almost
forgotten that Madame Alia&#8217;s ghosts were a cheat,
and the touch of her hand made him start, but her
first words brought him to himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get your
chance in a minute. Put on a pair of black felt
slippers. Here&#8221;&mdash;she groped along the floor,
and gave him the slippers. They were large, and
went easily over his shoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the black robe, just behind you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took it from its peg, and slipped into it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cover your head and face with the hood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did as directed, finding the eyeholes with his
fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hide your hands in the sleeves. Now, listen.
I&#8217;m going to keep them busy looking at the curtains.
When you hear a gong ring three times,
come through the panel, and go between the curtain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
and the wall-hanging, on the side toward the
window. The gas is down to a pinpoint. Those
folks think they can see a lot more than they do.
But they won&#8217;t see you, unless you show some
white. Anyhow they&#8217;ll be watching the cabinet.
Keep outside the circle of chairs, and work your
way to the door of the next room. There are
hangings there; go through them. You&#8217;ll find
light enough in the next room to get to the door
into the hall. First stuff the robe under the sofa.
You&#8217;ll <i>find</i> your hat under there. You left it here
when you came, and I tucked it away. You&#8217;d better
wear the slippers down to the street. Never
mind about returning them&mdash;unless you care to
come. Now, be careful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Japanese&mdash;where are they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the other side of the circle. Don&#8217;t worry
about them. They&#8217;re only kids when it comes to
my game. Now, wait till I get the things I need.&#8221;
She slipped past him in the closet, and he heard
faint rustlings as she gathered her paraphernalia.
Soon she was back at the panel. The last stanza
of the hymn was drawing to a close. &#8220;Be sure
you follow directions,&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221; He pressed her hand gratefully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and you won&#8217;t forget me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a sudden yearning that seemed to be beyond
her control, she leaned her body against him.
Her warm breath was on his face; her arm found
its way around him and held him convulsively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to have you
go. Don&#8217;t forget me&mdash;please don&#8217;t forget me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never forget you, and what you have
done for me,&#8221; he answered gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will come back and see me&mdash;sometime?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come back. And I should like to bring
a friend, who will have even more cause to thank
you than I have."
</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend?&#8221; A tinge of apprehension colored
the question: &#8220;A&mdash;a woman?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The soft curves of her body were quickly withdrawn
from him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I want
to see her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment she stood motionless. Then
she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sorry you kissed me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her lips brushed his forehead, and he was alone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
Groping with one hand, he assured himself that the
panel remained open. All in black, he awaited
the signal.
</p>
<p>And now strange manifestations began in the
room without. There were rappings, some faint,
some loud&mdash;coming apparently from all quarters.
Invisible fingers swept gently across the strings of
a guitar. Then came the soft clangor of a gong&mdash;once,
twice, three times.
</p>
<p>Orme slipped through the panel, into the cabinet.
Keeping close to the wall, he moved to the
left and worked out into the room. The rappings
were now louder than before&mdash;loud and continuous
enough to cover any slight sound he might make.
A little gasp came from the circle as he went out
into the room. At first he thought that he had
been seen. To his eyes, fresh from complete darkness,
the room seemed moderately light; but the
gas was little more than a tiny blue dot.
</p>
<p>As he took a step forward he saw why the circle
had gasped. Through the curtains of the cabinet
came the semblance of a tenuous wraith in long,
trailing robes of white. It was almost formless,
its outlines seeming to melt into the gloom.
</p>
<p>Advancing a little way into the circle, it shrank
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
back as though timorous, then wavered. From
the circle came a woman&#8217;s voice&mdash;anxious, eager,
straining with heart-break&mdash;&#8220;Oh, my sister!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The figure turned toward her, slowly extended
its arms, and glided back to the curtains, where it
stood as though waiting.
</p>
<p>The sobbing woman arose from her chair and
hastened toward the wraith.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Agnes!&#8221; she whispered imploringly. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
you speak to me, Agnes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The ghostly figure slowly shook its head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you happy, Agnes? Tell me. Oh, don&#8217;t
go until you have told me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The figure nodded mutely, and with a final slow
gesture, waved the woman back to her seat.
</p>
<p>Meantime Orme cast his eyes over the circle.
Dimly he saw faces, some stolid, some agitated;
and there, at the farther end were the two Japanese,
intent as children on these wonders. Their
sparkling eyes were directed to the cabinet.
</p>
<p>The apparition had disappeared between the
curtains. But now there was a fresh gasp of wonder,
as the figure of a little child stepped out
into the room. It did not go far from the cabinet,
and it alternately advanced and retreated,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
turning this way and that, as though looking for
someone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wants its mother!&#8221; exclaimed one of the
women in the circle. &#8220;Is your mother here, little
one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The child stared at the speaker, then withdrew
to the curtains.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will begin to talk after a while,&#8221; explained
the woman&mdash;&#8220;when the control gets
stronger. I always feel so tender for these little
lost spirits that come back to hunt for their loved
ones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme moved swiftly around the circle. He
passed so close to the Japanese that he could have
touched them. The felt slippers made his steps
noiseless; the thick rug absorbed the shock of his
weight.
</p>
<p>He passed through the hangings of the doorway
to the next room. There he had no gaslight; the
window-shades, however, were not drawn so closely
but that a little daylight entered. He removed
the robe and stuffed it under the old sofa at one
side.
</p>
<p>His hat, as Madame Alia had said, was there,
and he put it on and went to the hall door. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
circle had begun to sing another hymn. Orme got
into the hall, shut the door silently, and hurried
down the stairs, the long-drawn strains of the song
following him and dying away as he neared the
street entrance. In the lower hall he removed the
felt slippers and tossed them into a corner.
</p>
<p>He was amazed at the loudness of the street
noises, and the glare of the sunlight as he stepped
to the sidewalk. He stood there blinking for a
moment, until his eyes became accustomed to the
light. The foot-procession of the city streamed
by him.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a man turned in toward the doorway,
and, with a startled exclamation, stopped short.
Orme found himself looking into the gleaming eyes
of Alcatrante.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>AN OLD MAN OF THE SEA</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Orme, you are the man I most wished
to see.&#8221; The minister&#8217;s voice carried a note of unrestrained
eagerness. He extended his hand.
</p>
<p>Orme accepted the salutation, mustering the appearance
of a casual meeting; he must keep Alcatrante
out of the building.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sorry that I could not be at your apartment
this morning,&#8221; continued Alcatrante, &#8220;and
I hope you did not wait too long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; replied Orme. &#8220;I waited for a little
while, but concluded that something had called you
away. Has Senhor Poritol recovered from his
anxiety?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; said Alcatrante. &#8220;But the course
of events has changed.&#8221; He linked his arm in
Orme&#8217;s and walked along with him toward the
center of the city. &#8220;You see,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;my
young friend Poritol overestimated the importance
of that marked bill. It did give the clue to the
hiding place of certain papers which were of great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
value to him. What he failed to realize was that
the papers could be of little importance to others.
And yet, so perturbed is he that he has asked me
to offer a considerable reward for the recovery of
these papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Alcatrante sent a slanting glance at
Orme. &#8220;The sum is ridiculously large, but he insists
on offering one thousand dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a sum,&#8221; said Orme calmly. He was
interested in the minister&#8217;s indirections.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the events of last night&#8221;&mdash;continued
Alcatrante, stopping short, with a significant
glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Orme indifferently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust that you did not think me absurd for
sending that detective to you. That I did so was
a result of poor Poritol&#8217;s frantic insistence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My young friend was so afraid that you
would be robbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was robbed,&#8221; laughed Orme, trying to make
light of the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how was that?&#8221; Alcatrante&#8217;s surprise
was well assumed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, after I said good-night to you, the two
Japanese caught me while I was going through
the tunnel to the courtyard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Orme!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are clever, those Japanese.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And afterward you went out again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante bit his lip. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he stammered,
&#8220;the detective reported that you were absent when
he arrived.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And therefore,&#8221; remarked Orme coolly, &#8220;he
got access to my apartment and, after rummaging
through my things, went sound asleep in my bedroom,
where I found him snoring when I returned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The minister swung his cane viciously at a bit
of paper that lay on the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not a clever detective,&#8221; continued
Orme. &#8220;And as for Poritol, don&#8217;t you think he
had better offer his reward to the Japanese?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Alcatrante. &#8220;They may have
stolen the clue from you, but I have reason to
think that the papers were already gone when
they went to look for them. Poritol is really
very anxious.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; added Alcatrante, after a short
wait, &#8220;he might even go as high as two thousand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed? Then there will surely be many answers
to his advertisement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he will not advertise.&#8221; Alcatrante
laughed. &#8220;Already he knows where the papers
are. While waiting for the clue of the bill, he
discovered what others had already availed themselves
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is curious.&#8221; Orme smiled. &#8220;How did
he discover that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a roundabout way. I won&#8217;t take time for
the story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked along in silence for a little distance.
Orme was figuring on an escape, for the minister&#8217;s
clutch on his arm was like that of a drowning
man&#8217;s. Finally he sought the simplest means of
getting away. &#8220;I have an engagement,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I shall have to leave you here. Thank you for
walking with me thus far.&#8221; He disengaged his
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Orme,&#8221; said Alcatrante, &#8220;why
should we beat around the bush?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, indeed?&#8221; said Orme.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Poritol knows that his papers are in your possession.
Speaking for him, I offer you five
thousand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you drag Poritol into this?&#8221; said
Orme. &#8220;You know that he has merely been your
agent from the start. You think he has bungled,
but I tell you, you are the one who bungled, for
you picked him to do the work. He had bad luck
hiring a burglar for you. He lost his head when
he ran away with another person&#8217;s motor-car and
had to hand the marked bill to a country justice.
He showed bad judgment when he tried to fool me
with a fancy lie. But you are the real bungler,
Senhor Alcatrante. Any capable diplomat could
tell you that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante&#8217;s yellow face grew white about the
lips. His eyes flashed balefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse you!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You know
more than is good for you. Take care!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme laughed in disgust. &#8220;Oh, drop this melodrama.
I am not afraid of cheap Machiavellis.
In this country there are some crimes that are not
excused by high office.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s teeth showed. &#8220;You shall see,
my young friend.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Doubtless. But let me tell you one thing; if
anything happens to me, my friends will know
where to look for the criminal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante snarled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If necessary,&#8221; continued Orme, &#8220;a word to
certain persons as to the commission for building
warships&mdash;Five hundred thousand, is it not? by
the new arrangement&mdash;in gold&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante, in ungovernable rage, raised his light
cane and struck. Orme fended the blow with his
arm, then wrenched the cane away and threw it
into the street. A swarm of passers-by gathered
about them so quickly that in a moment they were
the center of a circle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You dunce,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;Do you want the
police?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; muttered Alcatrante, controlling himself
with a great effort. &#8220;You are right.&#8221; He
darted into the crowd at one side, and Orme, quick
to take the hint, disappeared in the opposite direction,
crossing the street and jumping into an
empty cab, which had drawn up in anticipation
of a fight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Rookery,&#8221; he ordered, naming the first
office-building that came into his head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the driver, and away they rattled.
</p>
<p>A glance back showed Orme that the crowd was
dispersing.
</p>
<p>At a distance was Alcatrante. He had seen
Orme&#8217;s escape, and was looking about vainly for
another cab. But cabs are not numerous on North
Parker Street, and Orme, so far as he could tell,
was not followed.
</p>
<p>When his cab drew up at the busy entrance on
La Salle Street, he found his way to the nearest
public telephone. The hour was close to five, and
he must discover quickly where he could find the
girl. He called up the Père Marquette. &#8220;This
is Mr. Orme,&#8221; he explained to the clerk. &#8220;Have
there been any calls or messages for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, Mr. and Mrs. Wallingham called up
at twelve-thirty to know if you were going to Arradale
with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The golfing engagement! Orme had not even
thought of it since the evening before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. A Japanese came about one o&#8217;clock.
He left no name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same man who came last evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, an older man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>The Japanese minister had doubtless gone
straight from Arima&#8217;s apartment to the Père Marquette.
&#8220;Anything else?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a &#8217;phone call for you about eleven
o&#8217;clock. The party left no name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s voice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. She said: &#8216;Tell Mr. Orme that I
shall not be able to call him up at noon, but will
try to do so as near two o&#8217;clock as possible.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she call up again at two?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. There&#8217;s no record of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme understood. In the interval after her attempt
to reach him she had learned at Arima&#8217;s of
his seeming treachery. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said to
the clerk, and hung up the receiver.
</p>
<p>What should he do now? The girl had given
him up. He did not know her name or where to
find her, and yet find her he must and that within
the next few hours. The unquestionably great
importance of the papers in his pocket had begun
to weigh on him heavily. He was tempted to take
them out, there in the telephone-booth, and examine
them for a clue. The circumstances justified
him.
</p>
<p>But&mdash;he had promised the girl! Stronger than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
his curiosity, stronger almost than his wish to deliver
the papers, was his desire to keep that
promise. It may have been foolish, quixotic; but
he resolved to continue as he had begun. &#8220;At ten
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;if I have not found
her, I will look at the papers or go to the police&mdash;do
whatever is necessary.&#8221; He did not like to
break promises or miss engagements.
</p>
<p>There was his engagement with the Wallinghams.
It had absolutely gone from his mind.
Bessie would forgive him, of course. She was a
sensible little woman, and she would know that his
failure to appear was due to something unavoidable
and important, but Orme&#8217;s conscience bothered
him a little because he had not, before setting out
that morning, telephoned to her that he might be
detained.
</p>
<p>Bessie Wallingham! She knew the girl! Why
had he not thought of that before?
</p>
<p>He got the Wallinghams&#8217; number. Were they
at home? No, they had gone to Arradale and
would probably remain until the last evening train.
He rang off.
</p>
<p>It remained to try Arradale. After some delay,
he got the clubhouse. Mrs. Wallingham? Yes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
she had just come in. Would Mr. Orme hold the
wire?
</p>
<p>Mr. Orme certainly would, and presently he was
rewarded for the delay by hearing Bessie&#8217;s brisk
little voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well you ought to be ashamed of yourself;
we waited over and took the next train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know all about these very busy
people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I was fooling, of course. But
we were sorry you didn&#8217;t come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl? Why, what&#8217;s the matter with
you, Robert Orme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Business importance? That won&#8217;t do, Bob.
You&#8217;ll have to &#8217;fess up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I know such a girl? Are you serious?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Bob, I can think of several. Shall I
name them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not give their names! What on earth is the
matter with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, part of the business, is it? Well, let me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
see. Tall and beautiful, you say. Dark eyes and
hair. A black touring-car. Hum! I know,
three girls to whom the description applies. It
might be&mdash;but you don&#8217;t wish me to mention the
name. Well, you&#8217;ll have to think of something
more distinctive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme thought in vain. The image of the girl
was ever in his mind, but describe her he could not.
At last he said: &#8220;The girl I mean lives in one
of the suburbs. She has a father who has lately
undergone a slight operation. He is, I think, a
man who is involved in negotiations with other
countries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Where did you meet her? Why, Bob,
how interesting! I never thought of her, but
she&#8217;s one of my dearest friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, listen, Bessie. It is absolutely necessary
that I should reach her father&#8217;s house before midnight.
You must help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He heard her laugh. &#8220;Help you? Of course
I will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does she live?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very far from Arradale. Bob, you come
right out here. I will see to the rest. It certainly
is the funniest coincidence.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll catch the first train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one at six&mdash;for men who come out to
dine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Expect me. Good-by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme looked at his watch. He had an hour and
a half&mdash;which meant that time must be killed. It
would be unwise to return to the Père Marquette,
for the South Americans and the Japanese might
both be on watch for him there. But he did not
care to wander about the streets, with the chance
of coming face to face with some of his enemies.
It was obvious that swift and elaborate machinery
would be set in motion to catch him. Of course,
there were many places where he could conceal
himself for an hour, but&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>Tom Wallingham&#8217;s office! Why had he not
thought of that before? Tom was at Arradale
with Bessie, but the clerks would let Orme stay in
the reception-room until it was time to start for his
train. Indeed, Orme remembered that Bixby, the
head clerk, had been at the wedding of Tom and
Bessie&mdash;had in fact taken charge of the arrangements
at the church.
</p>
<p>Moreover, Tom&#8217;s office was in this very building&mdash;the
Rookery. Doubtless it was for this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
reason that the Rookery had popped into his head
when he gave directions to the cab-driver on
North Parker Street.
</p>
<p>Hurrying to the elevators, Orme was about to
enter the nearest one, when suddenly a hand seized
his elbow and pulled him to one side. He turned
quickly and saw&mdash;Alcatrante.
</p>
<p>The minister was breathing rapidly. It was
plain that he had made a quick pursuit, but though
his chest heaved and his mouth was partly open,
his eyes were curiously steady. &#8220;One minute, Mr.
Orme,&#8221; he said, forcing his lips to a smile. &#8220;I
had hard work to follow you. There was no other
cab, but a small boy told me that you directed your
driver to the Rookery. Therefore, I got on a
street-car and rode till I found a cab.&#8221; He said
all this in the most casual tone, retaining his hold
on Orme&#8217;s elbow as though his attitude were familiar
and friendly. Perhaps he was thus detailing
his own adventures merely to gain time; or perhaps
he was endeavoring to puzzle Orme.
</p>
<p>But Orme was simply annoyed. He knew how
dangerous Alcatrante could be. &#8220;I am tired of
being followed, Senhor,&#8221; he said disgustedly, freeing
his elbow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>Alcatrante continued to smile. &#8220;That is part
of the game,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will find the game serious.&#8221; Orme
shut his lips together and glanced about for a
policeman.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante again grasped his elbow. &#8220;Do you
want publicity?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Your principals
do not. Publicity will injure us all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme had been given enough light to know that
the South American&#8217;s words were true.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it comes to publicity,&#8221; continued Alcatrante
with an ugly grin, &#8220;I will have you arrested
for stealing a certain important&mdash;document and
offering to sell it to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; laughed Orme. &#8220;That would
never work at all. Too many persons understand
my part in this matter. And then&#8221;&mdash;as he noticed
the flash of triumph in Alcatrante&#8217;s eyes&mdash;&#8220;I
could not be arrested for stealing a document
which was not in my possession.&#8221; It was too late;
Alcatrante had been able to verify his strong suspicion
that Orme had the papers.
</p>
<p>A wave of anger swept over Orme. &#8220;Publicity
or no publicity,&#8221; he said, &#8220;unless this annoyance
stops, I will have you arrested.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>Alcatrante smiled. &#8220;That would not pay, Mr.
Orme. There would be counter-charges and you
would be much delayed&mdash;perhaps even till after
midnight to-night. You Americans do not know
how to play at diplomacy, Mr. Orme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Controlling himself, Orme hurried quickly to
the nearest elevator. He had timed his action;
the starter was just about to close the door as he
hurried in. But quick though he was, Alcatrante
was close behind him. The agile South American
squeezed into the elevator by so close a margin
that the door caught his coat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! What you tryin&#8217; to do?&#8221; shouted
the starter.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante, pressing in against Orme, did not
reply.
</p>
<p>The starter jerked the door open, and glared at
Alcatrante. The steady and undisturbed eye of
the minister had its effect, and after a moment of
hesitation the starter banged the door shut and
gave the signal and the car leaped upward.
</p>
<p>Tom Wallingham&#8217;s office was on the eighth
floor. Though he knew that Alcatrante would
cling to him, Orme could think of nothing better
to do than to go straight to the office and count
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
on the assistance of Bixby, who would certainly
remember him. Accordingly he called out
&#8220;Eight!&#8221; and, ignoring Alcatrante, left the elevator
and walked down the hall, the South American
at his elbow.
</p>
<p>They passed a long series of doors, the glass
panels of which were inscribed, &#8220;The Wallingham
Company&mdash;Private,&#8221; with index-fingers pointing
the direction of the main entrance. This was the
Chicago branch of the great New York Corporation,
and Thomas Wallingham, senior, had placed
his son in charge of it two years before. The
business was the manufacturing of refrigerators.
One side of the reception-room which Orme entered
hurriedly, Alcatrante still beside him, was given
over to a large specimen refrigerator chamber,
built in with glistening white tiles. The massive
door, three feet thick, was wide open, showing the
spotless inner chamber. In the outer wall was a
thermometer dial fully a foot in diameter.
</p>
<p>Once inside the reception-room, Orme stopped
and looked again at Alcatrante. There was
menace in the look, but the South American did
not flinch. Indeed, the glance which met his own
seemed to Orme to be disarmingly good-natured.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
Its essence was a humorous recognition that the
situation had its ridiculous side.
</p>
<p>But Orme, knowing that much was at stake, did
not for an instant trust his unwelcome companion.
Alcatrante would cling to him like an Old Man of
the Sea, awaiting the opportunity to get the better
of him. Every wile would be employed; but
publicity was no part of the game&mdash;Orme began
really to believe that.
</p>
<p>To shake off Alcatrante, perhaps there was no
better way than to lure him to some deserted place
and overpower him. But would not Alcatrante be
likely to have anticipated such a move? And
would he not resort to desperate measures of his
own before Orme could put his own plans into
practice? Bixby might help.
</p>
<p>Orme walked over to the inquiry-window. &#8220;I
want to see Mr. Bixby,&#8221; he said, offering his card.
</p>
<p>The young woman behind the window took the
card, but at the same time she said: &#8220;Mr. Bixby
left a few minutes ago. He won&#8217;t be back to-day.
Shall I keep the card for him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, thank you,&#8221; he said, turning
away. Luck was against him. Besides Bixby
no one in that office knew him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>Alcatrante smiled genially. &#8220;Since Mr. Bixby
is absent,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;shall we leave the verification
of the notes until to-morrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; exclaimed
Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8221;&mdash;Alcatrante&#8217;s face was the picture of
astonishment&mdash;&#8220;the Wallingham Company notes,
of course. The notes you wish to sell me.&#8221; His
voice was raised so that the girl behind the window
could not help hearing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot!&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; A note of indignation crept into
Alcatrante&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Are you evading? Perhaps
you thought I would not insist on the verification.&#8221;
Another clerk, a man, had joined the girl
behind the window. Alcatrante suddenly addressed
him. &#8220;This Mr. Orme told me that he
needed to raise money and would transfer to me
cheap some notes signed by your company. I met
him at the hotel. He said that, if I would come
here with him, he would show the notes and have
them verified. I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The clerk left the window and, opening a door,
came into the reception-room. &#8220;What are the
notes you have?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have none,&#8221; replied Orme, in disgust. &#8220;I
have never pretended to have any. This man is
crazy, I think.&#8221; He pointed to Alcatrante. &#8220;He
has followed me here uninvited for reasons of his
own. I asked for Mr. Bixby, whom I know. I
would have asked for Mr. Wallingham, my personal
friend, but that I had already learned of his
being at Arradale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s funny business here somewhere,&#8221; exclaimed
Alcatrante, with great earnestness. &#8220;Do
you mean to say that you did not introduce yourself
to me in the lobby of the Framington and ask
me to buy the notes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme did not answer.
</p>
<p>With a conservative eye the clerk looked at the
two. He was not one to involve himself in a
dubious affair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t settle this matter for you, gentlemen,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>With a slight bow, Orme went into the hall.
It dawned upon him why Alcatrante had invented
so remarkable a story. Without question, the
minister had feared that Orme would enlist aid in
the office, or that at least he would manage to deposit
the coveted papers in safety while he found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
other means to get rid of his shadow. Hence
the sudden effort to discredit Orme.
</p>
<p>In the long corridor Orme gave no further attention
to Alcatrante, who was pattering along
beside him. The course he now had in mind was
to hire a cab and ride out of the city&mdash;all the way
to Arradale, if possible. The distance could not be
much greater than fifteen miles. If Alcatrante
chose to pursue, well and good. There would be
ways of disposing of him.
</p>
<p>Then an audacious notion flashed into Orme&#8217;s
mind. Why not let Alcatrante ride with him? Why
not take the minister all the way to his destination
and at the end turn him over as a prisoner?
</p>
<p>The idea was hardly practicable. He might
meet other enemies, and in that event he would
not care to have an enemy already at his side.
It came to him for the first time that the nearer
he approached his goal, the greater would be the
opposition he would have to overcome. Whatever
else the South Americans and Japanese might do,
they would have their guards about the house of
the girl&#8217;s father. Hitherto he had assumed that,
once free of Alcatrante and safe on the train to
Arradale, he would have plain going; but now he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
realized that the dangers would pile up higher
as he advanced. In any event, he must get rid of
Alcatrante, and as they approached the elevator
grills, he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Senhor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;unless you stop following
me, I shall be obliged to hurt you. I give you fair
warning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante laughed. &#8220;If you hurt me, as you
threaten, you will find yourself in difficulties. You
will be arrested, and you will have no opportunity
to deliver the documents on time. My position
as minister&mdash;my extra-territoriality&mdash;will make
it very difficult for you to extricate yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme looked grimly down into the sallow face.
&#8220;My fist against your chin,&#8221; he said, &#8220;might
do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante did not lose his smile. &#8220;You will
hardly try that, I think. There would not be
time for you to get away. People in these passing
elevators would see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme turned away and pressed the &#8220;down&#8221;
button, and a few seconds later a descending car
stopped. He pushed his way in, Alcatrante after
him.
</p>
<p>The elevator was crowded. Clerks and stenographers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
were beginning to leave their offices, for
the hour was nearly five. Orme wedged his way
in at one side and, in order to gain a momentary
sense of seclusion, turned his back upon the persons
who were pressing against him and stood
with face to the side of the cage, looking through
the scroll-work of the grating to the swiftly ascending
cables in the next well. He was conscious
that Alcatrante stood close to him as the car began
to slip downward. It was all very ridiculous, this
persistent pursuit of him.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Alcatrante&#8217;s voice burst out, &#8220;Stop
the car! I&#8217;ve been robbed! Stop the car!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was immediate commotion; a girl
screamed, and the swaying of the huddled group
made the car rattle. The elevator-man quickly
threw over his lever. The car stopped with a
jerk, between floors.
</p>
<p>Orme had started to turn with the others, but
with a quick exclamation he checked his movement
and pressed his face again to the grating. A remarkable
thing had happened. The ascending car
in the next well had stopped at Alcatrante&#8217;s outcry.
The few passengers it was carrying, eager
to see what was happening, hurried to the side
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
nearest to Orme. Less than two feet from his
face was the face of a girl. Almost before he
saw her at all he knew her. He forgot that he
had given her apparent cause to doubt him; he
did not stop to wonder what she was doing in
this building.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl!&#8221; he whispered.
</p>
<p>Her lips parted; her eyes opened wider.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl! Go to Tom Wallingham&#8217;s office. I&#8217;ll
come up there. Keep out of sight when you hear
me coming. Alcatrante is with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the papers,&#8221; he added, and his heart
thumped happily when he saw joy and gratitude
flash into her eyes.
</p>
<p>From his position and manner he might have
been explaining to her what was happening in
his own car. But now, conscious of the necessity
of taking part in the discussion about him, he
reluctantly turned away from the girl.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante was still exclaiming volubly. His
purse had disappeared. It had been in his pocket
just before he entered the car. Therefore someone
in the car must have taken it. He did not
accuse any single person, though he flashed suspicious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
glances at Orme, who recognized, of course,
that the move was directed against himself.
</p>
<p>To embarrass Orme with arrest and detention
would well suit the purposes of Alcatrante. At
this late hour such an event would prevent the
delivery of the papers. Orme wondered whether
the minister had realized that the papers might
be found by the police and disposed of properly.
The explanation of this apparent oversight on the
part of Alcatrante was not difficult, however, for,
perhaps it was not a part of the plan that Orme
should be actually thrown into a cell. It was
more likely that an arrest would be followed, after
as much delay as Alcatrante could secure, by a
refusal to prosecute. One advantage to Alcatrante
would be the opportunity of getting assistance
while Orme was in the hands of the police
so that after the prisoner was released he would
have more than one person to contend with. Alcatrante
would give up acting alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody has my purse!&#8221; Alcatrante was
shouting. &#8220;Somebody here! You must not let
anybody out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The elevator-boy had been gaping in seeming
paralysis, but now several of the passengers&mdash;men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
who doubtless were sure of their positions&mdash;were
angrily ordering him to take the car down. Some
of them had trains to catch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; screamed Alcatrante.
</p>
<p>Orme had kept out of the discussion, but now
he spoke quietly. &#8220;I think, Senhor Alcatrante&#8221;&mdash;he
uttered the name distinctly, knowing that
the South American probably did not wish himself
identified&mdash;&#8220;I think that, if the boy will take
the car almost to the bottom, the starter will help
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a chorus of seconds to this suggestion.
The boy pulled the lever and let the car
descend slowly, while Alcatrante continued to
exclaim.
</p>
<p>How would the South American try to throw
suspicion where he wished it? Orme puzzled over
this question, for certainly the police would not
arrest all the passengers. And then he suddenly
remembered how Alcatrante had crowded against
him when they entered the car.
</p>
<p>A cold wave of horror swept over him. Was it
possible that&mdash;&mdash;?
</p>
<p>He put his hand into the left side pocket of his
coat. Something was there that did not belong
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
there&mdash;a smooth, bulging purse. Alcatrante had
put it there.
</p>
<p>Orme fingered the purse. He would have to get
rid of it, but he dared not to drop it to the floor,
and if he thrust it through the grating and let
it fall into the elevator well, someone would be
almost certain to detect the action. There was
only a moment left before the car would stop.
He looked down at Alcatrante, who was close in
front of him. Then his face relaxed and in spite
of the gravity of his situation he smiled; for he had
found a solution. Promptly he acted upon it.
</p>
<p>The car halted just below the ceiling of the
first floor. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;
called a voice&mdash;the voice of the starter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man robbed,&#8221; said the elevator-boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring the car down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; shouted Alcatrante. &#8220;The thief is in
the car. He must not escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let him out. Bring the car down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy let the car descend to the floor level.
The starter placed himself against the gate. &#8220;Now
then, who was robbed?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>Alcatrante crowded forward. &#8220;It was I. My
purse is gone. I had it just before I got in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was you, was it?&#8221; The starter remembered
the trouble Alcatrante had made a few
minutes before. &#8220;Sure you didn&#8217;t drop it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am certain that I did not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The passengers were shuffling their feet about,
in a vain effort to touch the lost property. A
young girl was giggling hysterically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you put it in the wrong pocket,
and didn&#8217;t look careful enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked, I looked,&#8221; exclaimed Alcatrante.
&#8220;Do you think I would not know. See! I put
it in this pocket, which now is empty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thrust his hand into the pocket which he
had indicated. Suddenly his expression changed
to astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Find it?&#8221; grinned the starter.
</p>
<p>With the blankest of looks Alcatrante pulled
the purse from his pocket. &#8220;It was not there
two minutes ago,&#8221; he muttered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been dreamin&#8217;,&#8221; remarked the starter,
opening the gate with a bang. &#8220;All out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme chuckled to himself. In a moment Alcatrante
would realize how the purse had been replaced
in his pocket, and he would be furious.
Meantime Orme entered another elevator, to go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
back to the eighth floor, and, as he had expected,
the minister followed him.
</p>
<p>When they were outside the office of the Wallingham
Company, Orme paused, his hand on the
door. &#8220;Senhor Alcatrante,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this business
must end. I shall simply have to call the
police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At your own risk,&#8221; said Alcatrante. Then
an ugly light flashed in his eyes and his upper lip
lifted above his yellow teeth. &#8220;You got the better
of me there in the elevator,&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t get the better again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme opened the office-door. He glanced about
the reception-room, to see whether the girl had
hidden herself. She was not in view; indeed, there
was even no one at the inquiry-window. Orme
reasoned that at this hour some of the clerks might
be leaving&mdash;which would mean, perhaps, that they
were first putting away their books. At least
they would not be expecting business callers.
</p>
<p>The door of the great sample refrigerator was
ajar only two or three feet. When Orme was
there a few minutes before it had been wide open.
He wondered whether the girl had chosen it as
her hiding-place. If she had, his plan of action
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
would be simplified, for he would slip the papers in
to her, then get Alcatrante from the room.
</p>
<p>In a casual way he folded his arms. He could
now put his hand into his inside coat-pocket and
the motion would hardly be noticed.
</p>
<p>For a moment he stood as though waiting for
someone to appear at the inquiry-window. Though
Alcatrante was watching him closely, Orme continued
to act as if he were the only person in the
room.
</p>
<p>And now the dial of the big thermometer in
the outer wall of the refrigerator appeared to
catch his eye, and he strolled over to it. This
placed him almost in the open doorway. Apparently
his eyes were on the dial, but in reality
he was glancing sidewise into the chamber of the
refrigerator. He glimpsed a moving figure in
there&mdash;heard a faint rustling. Thrusting his
hand into the inside of his coat, he was about to
take out the precious papers to pass them in to
her.
</p>
<p>Then he received a violent push from behind.
He plunged forward, tripped with one foot on the sill
of the refrigerator doorway, and went in headlong,
sprawling on the tiled floor. His clutching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
hand caught the fold of a woman&#8217;s skirt. Then,
though he remained conscious, everything suddenly
turned black.
</p>
<p>Bewildered as he was, several seconds passed before
he realized that the massive door had been
closed&mdash;that he and the girl were prisoners.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>PRISONERS IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>

<p>Orme&#8217;s hand still held her skirt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl!&#8221; he whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Are you hurt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her voice came to him softly with all its solicitude
and sympathy. She knelt, to help him if need
be, and her warm, supple hand rested gently on his
forehead. He could have remained for a long
time as he was, content with her touch, but his
good sense told him that their safety demanded
action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not hurt at all,&#8221; he said, and as she withdrew
her hand, he arose. &#8220;Alcatrante caught me off
guard,&#8221; he explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him. There wasn&#8217;t time to warn
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been dogging me for an hour,&#8221; Orme
continued. &#8220;I felt as though he were sitting on
my shoulders, like an Old Man of the Sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know him of old,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;He is never
to be trusted.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;how did you happen to be here, in
the Rookery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the hope of finding you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Finding me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I called up the Père Marquette about five minutes
ago, and the clerk said that you had just been
talking to him on the wire, but that he didn&#8217;t know
where you were. Then I remembered that you
knew the Wallinghams, and I came to Tom&#8217;s office
to see if he had any idea where you were. I
was on my way when I passed you in the elevator.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom and Bessie are at Glenview,&#8221; explained
Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the girl at the inquiry-desk told me.
She went to get her hat to leave for the night,
and I slipped into this chamber to wait for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And here we are,&#8221; Orme laughed&mdash;&#8220;papers
and all. But I wish it weren&#8217;t so dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme hunted his pockets for a match. He found
just one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose, Girl, that you happen to have
such a thing as a match.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed lightly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;no.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have only one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
strike it, so that we can get our bearings.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>He scratched the match on his sole. The first
precious moment of light he permitted himself to
look at her, fixing her face in his mind as though
he were never to see it again. It rejoiced him
to find that in that instant her eyes also turned
to his.
</p>
<p>The interchange of looks was hard for him to
break. Only half the match was gone before he
turned from her, but in that time he had asked and
answered so many unspoken questions&mdash;questions
which at the moment were still little more than
hopes and yearnings. His heart was beating rapidly.
If she had doubted him, she did not doubt
him now. If she had not understood his feeling
for her, she must understand it now. And the
look in her own eyes&mdash;could he question that it was
more than friendly? But the necessity of making
the most of the light forced him to forget for
the moment the tender presence of the girl who
filled his heart. He therefore employed himself
with a quick study of their surroundings.
</p>
<p>The chamber was about ten feet square, and
lined smoothly with white tiling. It was designed
to show the sanitary construction of the Wallingham
refrigerator. Orme remembered how Tom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
had explained it all to him on a previous visit
to Chicago.
</p>
<p>This was merely a storage chamber. There was
no connection with an ice-chamber, and there were
none of the hooks and shelves which would make
it complete for its purpose. The only appliance
was the thermometer, the coils of which were fitted
in flush with the tiling, near the door, and protected
by a close metal grating. As for the door
itself, its outline was a fine seam. There was a
handle.
</p>
<p>As the match burned close to his fingers, Orme
pulled out his watch. It was twenty-nine minutes
past five.
</p>
<p>Darkness again.
</p>
<p>Orme groped his way to the door and tugged
at the handle. The door would not open; built
with air-tight nicety, it did not budge in the
least.
</p>
<p>This was as Orme had expected. He knew that
Alcatrante would have shot the bolt. He knew,
too, that Alcatrante would be waiting in the corridor,
to assure himself that the last clerk left the
office without freeing the prisoner&mdash;that all the
lights were out and the office locked for the night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
Then he would depart, exulting that the papers
could not be delivered; and in the morning Orme
would be released.
</p>
<p>But had Alcatrante realized that the chamber
was air-tight? Surely he had not known that the
girl was already there. The air that might barely
suffice to keep one alive until relief came would
not suffice for two.
</p>
<p>There was not the least opening to admit of ventilation.
Even the places where, in a practical refrigerator,
connection would be made with the
ice-chamber, were blocked up; for that matter,
they were on that side of the chamber which was
built close into the corner of the office.
</p>
<p>Orme drove his heel against the wall. The tiles
did not break. Then he stepped back toward the
middle of the chamber.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you, Girl?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; she answered, very near him.
</p>
<p>He reached out and found her hand, and she
did not withdraw it from his clasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rascal has locked us in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid we shall have a long wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it do any good to shout?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one could hear us through these walls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
No, there&#8217;s nothing to do but remain quiet. But
you needn&#8217;t stand, Girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led her to the wall. Removing his coat, he
folded it and placed it on the floor for a cushion,
and she seated herself upon it. He remained standing
near by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;are in that coat you
are sitting on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed, with a consciousness of the grim
and terrible humor of their situation&mdash;which he
hoped she had not yet realized. Here they were,
the hard-sought papers in their possession, yet
they were helpless even to save their own lives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you <i>would</i> shout,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, and going over to the
door, he called out several times with the full
power of his lungs. The sound, pent in that narrow
room, fairly crashed in their ears, but there
was no answer from without.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it again,&#8221; she said at last. Then
she sighed. &#8220;Oh, the irony of it!&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;But don&#8217;t give up,
Girl. We&#8217;ll deliver those papers yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not give up,&#8221; she said, gravely. &#8220;But
tell me, how did you get the papers?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>Orme began the story of the afternoon&#8217;s adventures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8221;&mdash;he stammered&mdash;&#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had been so conscious of his feeling toward
her, so conscious of the fact that the one woman
in all the world was locked in here alone with
him, that since he arranged her seat he had not
trusted himself to be near her. And she did not
seem to understand.
</p>
<p>She wished him to sit beside her, not knowing
that he felt the almost overpowering impulse to
take her in his arms and crush her close to him.
That desire would have been more easily controlled,
had he not begun to believe that she in
some degree returned his feeling for her. If they
escaped from this black prison, he would rest
happy in the faith that her affection for him, now,
as he supposed so largely friendly, would ripen
into a glorious and compelling love. But it would
not be right for him to presume&mdash;to take advantage
of a moment in which she might think that
she cared for him more than she actually did.
Then, too, he already foresaw vaguely the possible
necessity for an act which would make it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
best that she should not hold him too dear. So
long he stood silent that she spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do sit down,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will give you
part of your coat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a tremulous note in her laugh, but
as he seated himself, she spoke with great seriousness.
&#8220;When two persons understand each other
as well as you and I,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and are as near
death as you and I, they need not be embarrassed
by conventions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We never have been very conventional with
each other,&#8221; he replied, shakily. Her shoulder was
against his. He could hear her breathing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now tell me the rest of the story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;First I must change your notion that we are
near death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He could feel that she was looking at him in
the blackness. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I know?&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;They will not find us until to-morrow.
There isn&#8217;t enough air to last. I have
known it from the first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone will open the door,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;We may have to stay here quite a while, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my friend. There is no likelihood that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
it will be opened. The clerks are leaving for the
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So finish the story,&#8221; she went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Finish the story!&#8221; That was all that he
could do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Finish the story!&#8221; His story and hers&mdash;only
just begun, and now to end there in the dark.
</p>
<p>But with a calmness as great as her own, he
proceeded to tell all that had happened to him
since he boarded the electric-car at Evanston and
saw Maku sitting within. She pressed his hand
gently when he described the trick by which the
Japanese had brought the pursuit to an end. She
laughed when he came to his meeting with the
detective in his apartment. The episode with
Madame Alia he passed over lightly, for part of
it rankled now. Not that he blamed himself foolishly
but he wished that it had not happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That woman did a fine thing,&#8221; said the girl.
</p>
<p>He went on to describe his efforts to get free
from Alcatrante.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you were under the table in Arima&#8217;s
room,&#8221; she exclaimed, when he had finished.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was there; but I couldn&#8217;t see you, Girl.
And you seemed to doubt me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To doubt you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember? You said that no
American had the papers; but you added, unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless Walsh, the burglar, had played a trick
on Poritol and held the true papers back. I went
straight from Arima&#8217;s to the jail and had another
talk with Walsh. He convinced me that he
knew nothing at all about the papers. He seemed
to think that they were letters which Poritol
wanted for his own purposes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, you did not doubt me.&#8221; Glad relief
was in his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never doubted you,&#8221; she said, simply.
</p>
<p>There was silence. Only their breathing and
the ticking of Orme&#8217;s watch broke the stillness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that Alcatrante knew that this
place was unventilated,&#8221; she remarked at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; and he didn&#8217;t know that you were here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks that you will be released in the
morning, and that you will think it wiser to
make no charges. What do you suppose his
conscience will say when he learns&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Girl, I simply can&#8217;t believe that there is no
hope for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What possible chance is there?&#8221; Her voice
was steady. &#8220;The clerks must all have gone by
this time. We can&#8217;t make ourselves heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I feel as though I should be fighting
with the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t open it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But some one of the clerks going out may
have seen that it was bolted. Wouldn&#8217;t he have
pushed the bolt back? I&#8217;m going to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He groped to the door and tugged at the handle.
The door, for all the effect his effort had on it,
might have been a section of solid wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back,&#8221; she called.
</p>
<p>He felt his way until his foot touched the coat.
As he let himself down beside her, his hand
brushed over her hair, and unconsciously she
leaned toward him. He felt the pressure of her
shoulder against his side, and the touch sent a
thrill through him. He leaned back against the
wall and stared into the blackness with eyes that
saw only visions of the happiness that might have
been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t make any effort to break out,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
she said. &#8220;It is useless. And every time we move
about and tug at the door, it makes us breathe
that much faster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;I suppose we can only sit
here and wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;I am wondering
why our situation does not seem more terrible
to me. It should, shouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think so,&#8221; he replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The relative importance of our worldly affairs,&#8221;
she went on dreamily, &#8220;appears to change
when one sees that they are all to stop at once.
They recede into the background of the mind.
What counts then is, oh, I don&#8217;t want to think of
it! My father&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her shoulders shook
for a moment under the stress of sudden grief,
but she quickly regained her control. &#8220;There,
now,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I won&#8217;t do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a time they sat in silence. His own whirling
thoughts were of a sort that he could not
fathom; they possessed him completely, they destroyed,
seemingly, all power of analysis, they
made him dumb; and they were tangled inextricably
in the blended impressions of possession and
loss.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;is your father
living?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And your mother?&#8221; she faltered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has been dead many years. And I have
no brothers or sisters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother died when I was a little child,&#8221;
she mused. &#8220;Death seemed to me much more awful
then than it does now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always more awful to those who are
left than to those who go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But don&#8217;t
think of that yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We <i>must</i> think of it,&#8221; she insisted.
</p>
<p>He did not answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t wish to die, do you?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; and I don&#8217;t wish you to die. Try to take
a different view, Girl. We really have a chance
of getting out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone may come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all likely,&#8221; she sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But a chance is a chance, Girl, dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, suddenly. &#8220;To think that
I have brought you to this! That what you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
thought would be a little favor to me has brought
you to death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She began to sob convulsively.
</p>
<p>It was as though for the first time she realized
her responsibility for his life; as though her confidence
in her complete understanding of him had
disappeared and he was again a stranger to her&mdash;a
stranger whom she had coolly led to the edge
of life with her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Girl&mdash;don&#8217;t!&#8221; he commanded.
</p>
<p>Her self-blame was terrible to him. But she
could not check her grief, and finally, hardly knowing
what he did, he put his arm around her and
drew her closer to him. Her tear-wet cheek
touched his. She had removed her hat, and her
hair brushed his forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl, Girl!&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know?&mdash;Don&#8217;t
you understand? If chance had not kept
us together, I would have followed you until I
won you. From the moment I saw you, I have
had no thought that was not bound up with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But think what I have done to you!&#8221; she
sobbed. &#8220;I never realized that there was this
danger. And you&mdash;you have your own friends,
your interests. Oh, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My interests are all here&mdash;with you,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;It is I who am to blame. I should have
known what Alcatrante would do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t know. There was no way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent you up here to wait for me. Then,
when he and I came in, I turned my back on him,
like a blind fool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she protested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it was, perhaps, something
that neither you nor I could foresee. No
one is to blame. Isn&#8217;t that the best view to take
of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her cheek moved against his as she inclined her
head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be selfish in me,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;but I
can&#8217;t feel unhappy&mdash;now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her sobs had ceased, and she buried her face
in his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you, Girl,&#8221; he said, brokenly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t expect you to care so much for me&mdash;yet.
But I must tell you what I feel. There isn&#8217;t&mdash;there
isn&#8217;t anything I wouldn&#8217;t do for you, Girl&mdash;and
be happy doing it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not speak, and for a long time they
sat in silence. Many emotions were racing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
through him. His happiness was almost a pain,
for it came to him in this extremity when there
was no hope ahead. She had not yielded herself,
but she had not resisted his embrace; even now
her head was on his shoulder. Indeed, he had
given her no chance to confess what she might
feel for him.
</p>
<p>Nor would he give her that chance. No, it
was better that her love for him&mdash;he knew now
that in her heart she must love him&mdash;it was better
that it should not be crystallized by definite expression.
For he had thought of a way by which
she, at least, might be saved. With the faint
possibility of rescue for them both, he hesitated to
take the step. And yet every moment he was using
that much more of the air that might keep her
alive through the night.
</p>
<p>It would be only right to wait until he was
reasonably sure that all the clerks in the office
had gone. That time could not be long now.
But already the air was beginning to seem close;
it was not so easy to breathe as it had been.
</p>
<p>Gently putting her from him, he said: &#8220;The air
will last longer if we lie down. The heart does
not need so much blood, then.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>She did not answer, but moved from her seat on
his folded coat, and he took it and arranged it as
a pillow and, finding her hand, showed her where
it was. He heard the rustle of her clothing as
she adjusted herself on the floor. She clung to
his hand, while he still sat beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, cheerfully, &#8220;I am going to
find out what time it is, by breaking the crystal
of my watch. I&#8217;ve seen blind men tell the time
by feeling the dial.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His watch was an old hunting-case which had
belonged to his father. He opened it and cracked
the crystal with his pocket-knife. As nearly as
he could determine by the sense of touch, it was
seven o&#8217;clock. Bessie Wallingham would be wondering
by this time why he had broken an engagement
with her for the second time that day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one thing more to do,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It is seven o&#8217;clock; I don&#8217;t know how much longer
we shall be able to breathe easily, and I am going
to write a note which will explain matters to the
persons who find us&mdash;if we should not happen to
be able to tell them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laboriously he penciled on the back of an old
envelope the explanation of their presence there,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
making a complete and careful charge against
Alcatrante. He laid the message on the floor.
</p>
<p>On second thought, he picked it up again and
put it in his pocket, for if by any chance they
should be rescued, he might forget it. In that
event its discovery would possibly bring an exposure
of facts which the girl and her father
would not care to have disclosed.
</p>
<p>A faint whisper from the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked, bending tenderly for
her answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must lie down, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He began to move away, as if to obey her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she whispered&mdash;&#8220;here. I want you near
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Slowly he reclined and laid his head on the coat.
Her warm breath was on his face. He felt for her
hand, and found it, and it held tightly to his.
</p>
<p>His own mind was still torn with doubts as to
the best course. Should he put himself out of the
way that she might live? The sacrifice might
prove unnecessary. Rescue might come when it
was too late for him, yet not too late, if he did not
hurry his own end. And if she truly loved him
and knew that she loved him, such an act on his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
part would leave her a terrible grief which time
would hardly cure.
</p>
<p>He tried to analyze their situation more clearly,
to throw new light on his duty. The clerks must
all have gone by now. There would be a visit or
two from a night watchman, perhaps, but there
was scarcely one chance in a hundred that he
would unbolt the door.
</p>
<p>The air was vitiating rapidly; they could not
both live through the night. But&mdash;if she loved
him as he loved her, she would be happier to die
with him than to live at the cost of his life.
</p>
<p>He pictured for himself again that last look
of her face: its beauty, its strength, its sweet
sympathy. He seemed to see the stray wisp of
hair that had found its way down upon her cheek.
Her perfect lips&mdash;how well he remembered!&mdash;were
the unopened buds of pure womanly passion.
</p>
<p>After all, whether she loved him or not, there
would still be much in life for her.
</p>
<p>Time would cure her sorrow. There would be
many claims upon her, and she would sooner or
later resume her normal activities.
</p>
<p>Slowly he disengaged his hand from her clinging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
fingers. In his other hand he still held his
pocket-knife. To open a vein in his wrist would
take but a moment. His life would well away,
there on the tiles.
</p>
<p>She would think he was asleep; and then she
herself would drift away into unconsciousness
which would be broken only after the door was
opened in the morning.
</p>
<p>Bah! His mind cleared in a flash. What a
fool he was! Need he doubt her for an instant?
Need he question what she would do when she
found that he was dead? And she would know it
quickly. This living pulsing girl beside him loved
him! She had told him in every way except in
words. In life and in death they belonged to each
other.
</p>
<p>They were one forever. They still lived, and
while they lived they must hope. And if hope
failed, there still would be love.
</p>
<p>His pent-up emotions broke restraint. With unthinking
swiftness, he threw his arm over her and
drew her tight to him. His lips found hers in a
long kiss&mdash;clung in ecstasy for another, and
another.
</p>
<p>Her arms went about his neck. He felt as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
though her soul had passed from her lips to his
own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My lover!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I think I have
always cared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, Girl, Girl!&#8221; He could utter no more.
</p>
<p>With a faint sigh she said: &#8220;I am glad it is to
be together.&#8221; She sat up, still holding his hand.
&#8220;If it need be at all,&#8221; she added, a new firmness
in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it need be at all!&#8221; Orme searched his
mind again for some promise of escape from this
prison which had been so suddenly glorified for
them. The smooth, unbreakable walls; the thin
seam of the door; the thermometer. Why had he
not thought of it before? The thermometer!
</p>
<p>With an exclamation, he leaped to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A chance! A small chance&mdash;but still a
chance!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He found his way to the handle of the door,
which his first attempt at escape had taught him
was not connected with the outer knob. Then
he located the covering which protected the coils
of the thermometer.
</p>
<p>Striking with his heel, he tried to break the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
metal grating. It would not yield. Again and
again he threw his weight into the blows, but
without effect.
</p>
<p>At last he remembered his pocket-knife. Thrusting
one end of it through the grating, he prodded
at the glass coils within. There was a tinkling
sound. He had succeeded.
</p>
<p>He groped his way back to the girl and seated
himself beside her. With the confession of their
love, a new hope had sprung up in them. They
might still be freed, and, though the air was becoming
stifling, neither of them believed that a
joy as great as theirs could be born to live but a
few hours.
</p>
<p>For the hundredth time he was saying: &#8220;I
can&#8217;t believe that we have known each other only
one day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And even now,&#8221; she mused, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know
my name. Do you want me to tell you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until you are ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then wait. It will all come in due form.
Someone will say, &#8216;Mr. Orme, Miss&mdash;&mdash;.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The name doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;To
me you will always be just&mdash;Girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The joyous moments rushed by. She had crept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
close to him again, and with her head on his shoulder,
was saying: &#8220;There is so much for us to
tell each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be only one thing to say now.&#8221;
He kissed her tenderly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but there is much more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall we begin?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to be matter-of-fact, do you live in
Chicago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear. I live in New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know that,&#8221; she whispered,
&#8220;And about me. Our family home has been in
one of the suburbs here since I was a small girl.
For several years I was sent East to school, and
after that I went abroad with some friends. And
since then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be so very long,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;though you speak as though it were decades.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is six years. Since then my father and I
have spent our winters in the East, coming back
home for the summers. Just think how much you
are learning about me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme lifted her hand to his lips.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the room filled with a light which to
their expanded pupils seemed bright as the sun.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
The door had been opened and an electric light in
the reception-hall shone in. Framed in the doorway
was the outline of a man.
</p>
<p>Orme shouted joyfully and jumped to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; the man began.
</p>
<p>Orme helped the girl up, and together they
went to the outer light. For a moment they could
do nothing but breathe, so good the fresh air of
the reception-room seemed to them. Then, looking
at the man again, Orme saw that it was the
clerk to whom Alcatrante had made his accusation
two hours before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come to be in there?&#8221; the clerk
demanded.
</p>
<p>Orme hesitated; then he decided to make no
charges. &#8220;I got rid of that crazy fellow who
was following me around,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I came
back, and this young lady and I went in to examine
your refrigerator. The door was ajar,
and someone pushed it shut and locked it. We
should have smothered if you had not come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the merest chance,&#8221; said the clerk.
&#8220;My work kept me late. As I was leaving, I
happened to glance at the thermometer dial here.
It registered below freezing. I couldn&#8217;t understand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
that, for there is no ice in the refrigerator,
so I opened the door to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I broke the coil,&#8221; explained Orme, &#8220;in the
hope that the night watchman might be interested
in the dial.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the clerk, drawing a long breath,
&#8220;you had a close shave. There isn&#8217;t any night
watchman&mdash;at least not in this office. If I had
balanced my books on time to-day, you two would
have stayed where you were until to-morrow morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come in to-morrow to see Mr. Wallingham
and explain everything. I will pay for a
new thermometer, too, if he will let me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he will let you do that,&#8221; said
the clerk. &#8220;He will be grateful that nothing
worse happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe he will,&#8221; replied Orme.
</p>
<p>He glanced at the clock. It was a quarter
after seven. Going back into the chamber which,
had been the scene of both their danger and their
happiness, he got his coat and the girl&#8217;s hat.
The parchment papers crackled in his pocket as
he put the coat on. The girl, meantime, adjusted
her hat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said the clerk, holding the outer door
open for them to pass through, &#8220;was that fellow&#8217;s
story about your holding notes of ours&mdash;was
there anything in it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely untrue,&#8221; replied Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have had you confused with somebody
else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have.&#8221; Orme held out his hand.
&#8220;Many thanks to you for saving our lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Orme and the girl made their way to the
elevator.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>FROM THE DEVIL TO THE DEEP SEA</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;How shall we go?&#8221; asked Orme, as they descended
to the street level.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By train. There is no other convenient way,
since my car is at home.&#8221; She looked at him
doubtfully, and added, &#8220;but they will be watching
the railroad stations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;A motor would be safer&mdash;if we
can get one.&#8221; He gave her hand a secret pressure
while the elevator-boy was opening the door
for them, and as she passed before him she flashed
upon him a look so filled with love and trust that
the sudden thrill of his happiness almost stifled
him.
</p>
<p>At the La Salle Street entrance Orme had a
fleeting glimpse of the watching Alcatrante. The
South American, after one astonished stare, darted
away in the dusk. He would follow them, of course,
but Orme decided to say nothing about him to
the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must telephone,&#8221; she said suddenly, stopping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
as if to turn back into the building. &#8220;Father
will be very anxious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The booths in the building must be closed,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;d better try a drug store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Accordingly they made their way to the nearest,
and the girl went to the booth. The door was
shut for a long time.
</p>
<p>While he was waiting, Orme glanced through
the brilliant window. In the light of an electric
lamp across the street he discerned faintly a motionless
figure; without hesitation he crossed the
pavement, recognizing Alcatrante more clearly as
he left the dazzle of the store.
</p>
<p>The minister did not budge. His face, as
Orme approached, was cold and expressionless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Senhor,&#8221; exclaimed Orme, &#8220;does your trade
include murder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. Why do you ask, Mr. Orme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because only a lucky intervention has saved
you from the murder of a young lady and myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are exaggerating, my dear sir.&#8221; Alcatrante
laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it your custom to lock people into air-tight
chambers?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Air-tight?&#8221; Alcatrante was clearly disconcerted.
&#8220;I did not suppose that it was air-tight.
Also, I did not dream that the young lady was
there. But this game is a serious game, Mr.
Orme. You do not appear to understand. When
one is working for his country, many strange
things are justified.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even murder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even murder&mdash;sometimes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme had an inspiration. &#8220;Thank you for the
truth, Senhor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I, too, am working for
my country. If you continue to follow us, I shall
assume that you have murder in your mind, and I
shall act accordingly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alcatrante smiled coolly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is fair warning,&#8221; continued Orme.
</p>
<p>He glanced to the drug store and saw the girl
coming out of the telephone-booth. Hastening
across the street, he met her at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If father had had any idea of such complications
when we came West,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there would
have been plenty of men near by to help us. As it
is, we shall have to act alone. It is not a matter
for detectives&mdash;or for the police, I&mdash;I almost
wish it were,&#8221; she faltered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>Orme wondered again whether this father could
have realized what dangers the girl was encountering.
But, as if divining his sudden anger
against the man who could let his daughter run
such risks, she added: &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know, of course,
the details of our adventures. I have permitted
him to think that it is simply a matter of searching.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now he is reassured.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Oh, you have no idea yet how important
it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were a long time in the booth,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>A mysterious smile flittered across her face. &#8220;I
thought of another person I wished to talk to.
That person was hard to get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Long distance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It proved necessary to use long distance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she caught a glimpse of the figure across
the street. &#8220;There&#8217;s Mr. Alcatrante,&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have just had a talk with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her face showed concern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him worry you, dear,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;He will try to balk us. We must expect that.
But I think I can take care of him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it,&#8221; she said, softly.
</p>
<p>He wondered whether she could guess how relentlessly
he was planning to deal with Alcatrante.
Would she justify the course he had in
mind? As to her attitude, he felt doubtful. Perhaps
she did not agree with the South American
that murder was sometimes necessary in the service
of one&#8217;s country.
</p>
<p>Moreover, while Alcatrante was undoubtedly
serving the interest of his country, Orme had no
real certainty that he himself was in a similar
position. He had every reason to infer that the
papers were of importance to the United States
Government, but after all he could only go by
inference. The affairs of some private corporation
in the United States might have a serious bearing
on problems in South America and the Far
East. He decided to sound the girl for information
that would be more definite.
</p>
<p>But first the question as to their next move
must be answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where we can get a motor?&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8221;&mdash;she prolonged the word doubtfully.
&#8220;We may have to take a motor-cab.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It would be safer than the railroad or the
electric line.&#8221; Then he asked with great seriousness
&#8220;Girl, dear, I don&#8217;t know much about the
meaning and value of these papers in my pocket,
and I don&#8217;t care to know any more than you
choose to tell me. But let me know just this much:
Are they as important to you as they are to our
enemies? Have you really been justified in the
risks you have run?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen how far Alcatrante and the
Japanese have been willing to go,&#8221; she replied,
gravely. &#8220;I am sure that they would not hesitate
to kill us, if it seemed necessary to them in their
effort to get possession of the papers. Now, my
dear, they are even much more important to my
father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In his business interests?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Much more than that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were walking along the glimmering cañon
of La Salle Street, which was now almost deserted
in the dusk. A motor-car swept slowly around
the corner ahead and came toward them. It had
but one occupant, a chauffeur, apparently. He
wore a dust-coat, a cap, and goggles which seemed
to be too large for him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>Regardless of Alcatrante, who was following
them, Orme hailed the chauffeur. &#8220;Will you take
a fare?&#8221; he called.
</p>
<p>The man stopped his car and after a moment
of what Orme interpreted as indecision, nodded
slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much by the hour?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>The chauffeur held up the ten fingers of his two
hands.
</p>
<p>Orme looked at the girl. He hadn&#8217;t that much
money with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I only had time to cash a check,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I have plenty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They got into the tonneau, and the girl, leaning
forward, said: &#8220;Take the Lake Shore Drive
and Sheridan Road to Evanston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the chauffeur nodded, without turning
toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t waste many words,&#8221; whispered the
girl to Orme.
</p>
<p>While the car was turning Orme noted that Alcatrante
had stopped short and was watching
them. It was some reason for surprise that he was
not hunting for a motor in which to follow.
</p>
<p>Perhaps his plans were so completely balked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
that he was giving up altogether. No, that would
not be like Alcatrante. Orme now realized that
in all likelihood the minister had foreseen some such
circumstance and had made plans accordingly.
</p>
<p>He was more and more inclined to believe that
Alcatrante had but half expected to keep him long
imprisoned in Wallingham&#8217;s office. Then what
had been the purpose underlying the trick? Probably
the intention was to make Orme prisoner
for as long a period as possible and, in any event,
to gain time enough to communicate with Poritol
and the Japanese and whatever other persons
might be helping in the struggle to regain the
papers. The probabilities were that Alcatrante
had been using the last two hours to get in touch
with his friends.
</p>
<p>And now those friends would be informed
promptly that Orme and the girl were setting out
by motor. This analysis apparently accounted for
Alcatrante&#8217;s nonchalance. Orme and the girl
seemed to be escaping, but in truth, if they approached
their destination at all, they must run
into the ambuscade of other enemies. Then the
nearer the goal, the greater the danger.
</p>
<p>As the motor slid smoothly northward on La
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
Salle Street, Orme looked back. Alcatrante had
made no move. The last glimpse that Orme had
of him showed that slight but sinister figure alone
on the sidewalk of the deserted business street.
</p>
<p>They crossed the Clark Street bridge. &#8220;Keep
on out North Clark Street until you can cross
over to Lincoln Park,&#8221; said Orme to the chauffeur.
</p>
<p>The only indication that the order had been
heard was a bending forward of the bowed figure
on the front seat.
</p>
<p>Orme explained to the girl. &#8220;It will be better
not to take the Lake Shore Drive. They may
be watching the Père Marquette.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As a precaution,
we&#8217;d better not pass the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How surprised I was to find you waiting for
me there last evening,&#8221; mused Orme&mdash;&#8220;and how
glad!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never called on a man before,&#8221; she laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had made up my mind only a little while before,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;to stay in Chicago till I
found you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that would not have been easy.&#8221;
She returned the pressure of his hand, which had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
found hers. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for those papers,
we might never have met.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were bound to meet&mdash;you and I,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I have been waiting all my life just for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But even now you don&#8217;t know who I am. I
may be a&mdash;a political adventuress&mdash;or a woman
detective&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you are the
woman I love. Your name&mdash;your business, if you
have one&mdash;those things don&#8217;t matter. I know
you, and I love you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She leaned closer to him. &#8220;Dear,&#8221; she whispered
impulsively, &#8220;I am going to tell you everything&mdash;who
I am, and about the papers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; He held his hand before her mouth.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me now. Do as you planned to do.
Be simply &#8216;Girl&#8217; to me for a while longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She moved closer to him. Their errand, the
danger, were for the time forgotten, and the motor
hummed along with a burden of happiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t looked at the papers yet,&#8221; said
Orme, after a time. They were turning east toward
Lincoln Park.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I need to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. I took them from the envelope
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
which you saw at Arima&#8217;s. But here they are.
I did not look at them, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He drew the parchments from within his coat
and placed them in her hand.
</p>
<p>While she examined them, he looked straight
ahead, that he might not see. He could hear them
crackle as she unfolded them&mdash;could hear her sigh
of content.
</p>
<p>And then something occurred that disquieted
him to a degree which seemed unwarranted. The
chauffeur suddenly turned around and glanced
swiftly through his goggles at the girl and the
papers. The action was, perhaps, natural; but
there was an assured expectancy in the way he
turned&mdash;Orme did not like it. Moreover, there was
something alarmingly familiar in the manner of
the movement.
</p>
<p>Somewhere Orme had seen a man move his body
like that. But before his suspicions could take
form, the chauffeur had turned again.
</p>
<p>The girl handed the papers back to Orme.
&#8220;These are the right papers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, my
dear, if you only knew how much they mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held them for a moment in his hand. Then,
after returning them to his pocket with as little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
noise as possible, he caught the girl&#8217;s eye and,
with a significant glance toward the chauffeur,
said in a distinct voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will slip them under the seat cushion. They
will be safer there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Did the chauffeur lean farther back, as if to
hear better? or was the slight movement a false
record by Orme&#8217;s imagination?
</p>
<p>Orme decided to be on the safe side, so he slipped
under the cushion of the extra seat another mining
prospectus which he had in his pocket, placing it
in such a way that the end of the paper protruded.
Then he put his lips close to the girl&#8217;s ear and
whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed, but tell me, does our chauffeur
remind you of anyone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She studied the stolid back in front of them.
The ill-fitting dust-coat masked the outline of the
figure; the cap was so low on the head that the
ears were covered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, at last, &#8220;I think not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With that, Orme sought to reassure himself.
</p>
<p>They were in Lincoln Park now. Over this
same route Orme and the girl had ridden less
than twenty-four hours before. To him the period
seemed like a year. Then he had been plunging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
into mysteries unknown with the ideal of his
dreams; now he was moving among secrets partly
understood, with the woman of his life&mdash;loving
her and knowing that she loved him.
</p>
<p>One short day had brought all this to pass. He
had heard it said that Love and Time are enemies.
The falseness of the saying was clear to him in
the light of his own experience. Love and Time
are not enemies; they are strangers to each
other.
</p>
<p>On they went northward. To Orme the streets
through which they passed were now vaguely
familiar, yet he could hardly believe his eyes
when they swung around on to the Lake Front
at Evanston, along the broad ribbon of Sheridan
Road.
</p>
<p>But there was the dark mysterious surface of
Lake Michigan at their right. Beyond the broad
beach, he could see the line of breakwaters, and
at their left the electric street lights threw their
beams into the blackness of little parks and shrubby
lawns.
</p>
<p>The car swept to the left, past the university
campus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember?&#8221; asked the girl, in a low
voice, pressing his arm. Then, &#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
whispered. &#8220;Someone will see!&#8221; for he had
drawn her face to his.
</p>
<p>They came to the corner of Chicago Avenue and
Sheridan Road, where they had halted the night
before in their search for the hidden papers.
&#8220;We&#8217;d better give him further directions,&#8221; said
the girl.
</p>
<p>But the chauffeur turned north at the corner
and put on more speed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s taking the right direction,&#8221; she laughed.
&#8220;Perhaps his idea is to follow Sheridan Road till
we tell him to turn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite like it,&#8221; said Orme, thoughtfully.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a bit too sure of what he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl hesitated. &#8220;It <i>is</i> funny,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;And he&#8217;s going faster, too.&#8221; She leaned
forward and called up to the chauffeur: &#8220;Stop at
this corner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not seem to hear. She repeated the order
in a louder voice, but the only answer was another
burst of speed.
</p>
<p>Then Orme reached up and touched the chauffeur&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;Stop the car!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>The chauffeur did not obey. He did not even
turn his head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>Orme and the girl looked at each other. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I am beginning to,&#8221; Orme replied.
&#8220;He will not stop until we are where he wishes us
to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t get out,&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. And if I pull him out of the seat, the
car will be ditched.&#8221; He puzzled vainly to hit on
a method of action, and meantime the moments
sped.
</p>
<p>They passed the university grounds quickly.
Orme retained an impression of occasional massive
buildings at the right, including the dome of an
observatory, and at the left the lighted windows
of dwellings.
</p>
<p>He saw, too, the tower of a lighthouse, a dark
foundation supporting a changing light above;
and then the road turned sharply to the left and,
after a few hundred yards, curved again to the
north.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the chauffeur slowed down. On either
side were groves of trees. Ahead were the lights
of an approaching motor.
</p>
<p>Orme was still at a loss, and the girl was awaiting
some decision from him. When the chauffeur
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
at last turned and spoke&mdash;three short words&mdash;Orme
realized too late the situation he and the girl
were in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We stop now,&#8221; said the chauffeur.
</p>
<p>And the girl, with a horrified gasp, exclaimed:
&#8220;Maku!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yes, it was the Japanese.
</p>
<p>Calmly he put on the brakes and brought the
car to a standstill by the roadside; then, removing
his goggles, turned to Orme and the girl and
smiled an unscrutable smile. There was an ugly
bruise on his forehead, where Orme had struck him
with the wrench.
</p>
<p>But quick though Maku was, he was not quick
enough to see a motion which Orme had made immediately
after the moment of recognition&mdash;a motion
which had even escaped the notice of the girl.
Perhaps it accounted for the coolness with which
Orme met his enemy&#8217;s eyes.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE STRUGGLE</h3>
</div>

<p>The approaching car now drew up near by, and
three men jumped lightly to the road.
</p>
<p>In the radiance of the lamps on the two cars,
Orme recognized Arima. The men with him were
also Japanese, though Orme was not conscious that
he had ever seen them before.
</p>
<p>It was clear enough how he and the girl had
blundered into the hands of the Orientals. Maku
had undoubtedly secured a car and had driven it
to the vicinity of the Rookery in response to a
telephoned order from Alcatrante, transmitted, in
all likelihood, through the Japanese minister.
</p>
<p>The appearance of the car on La Salle Street
had been expected by the South American. Perhaps
he had not anticipated that Orme would hail
it; the probability was that he had wished Maku&#8217;s
assistance without a definite idea of what that assistance
should be; but the use of the car by Orme
fell in nicely with his plans. He had assumed
readily enough the direction the car would take,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
and getting promptly into telephonic communication
with Arima, had arranged this meeting on
the road.
</p>
<p>Orme now remembered that Arima&#8217;s car, when
approaching, had sounded its horn at regular intervals,
in series of threes&mdash;evidently a signal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Girl, dear,&#8221; whispered Orme.
&#8220;I&mdash;&#8221; he broke off his sentence as the newcomers
clustered about the tonneau, but the confident
glance of her eyes reassured him.
</p>
<p>He knew not what they were to face. The Japanese,
he inferred, would not deal with him pleasantly,
but surely they would not harm the girl.
</p>
<p>Arima opened the door of the tonneau and with
a lightning motion grasped Orme by the wrist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out,&#8221; he ordered.
</p>
<p>Orme was in no mind to obey. There were
four of the Orientals against him, and he stood
little chance of success in a fight with them, but if
he could only delay matters, someone might pass
and he could raise an alarm. So he sat firm, and
said, calmly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out,&#8221; repeated Arima.
</p>
<p>When Orme still made no move to leave his seat,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
the steely fingers on his wrist ran up his forearm
and pressed down hard upon a nerve-center. The
pain was almost unbearable, and for the moment
his arm was paralyzed. A quick jerk brought
him to the ground. As he alighted, stumblingly,
Maku caught him by the other arm. He was held
in such a way that for the moment it seemed futile
to struggle. Arima, meantime, spoke rapidly in
Japanese to Maku. Perhaps he, as commander of
the situation, was giving precise orders as to what
was to be done.
</p>
<p>Orme looked over his shoulder at the girl. She
was clutching the door of the tonneau and leaning
forward, staring with horrified eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep cool,&#8221; he counseled.
</p>
<p>Her answer was a moan of anguish, and he
realized that she feared for him.
</p>
<p>Suddenly she began to call for help. Twice her
cries rung out, and then one of the Japanese leaped
into the tonneau and placed his hand over her
mouth, smothering her voice.
</p>
<p>The sight of this action was too much for Orme.
He began a furious effort to break away from his
captors. One sudden motion freed his right arm
from Arima&#8217;s clutch, and he reached for Maku&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
throat. But after a moment of scuffling, he was
again held securely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;don&#8217;t try to call out.
Keep quiet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Japanese in the tonneau appeared to understand
the words, for he took his hand away from
the girl&#8217;s mouth, though he remained beside her,
ready to put an end to any fresh outbreak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Orme, turning his eyes on Arima,
&#8220;what does this mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You give us papers,&#8221; replied the Japanese
softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no papers that mean anything to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We see. Give them to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What papers do you want?&#8221; demanded Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know.&#8221; Arima&#8217;s voice sounded less
patient.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have nothing that you care anything
about,&#8221; repeated Orme.
</p>
<p>At that Arima began rapidly to search Orme&#8217;s
pockets. There was sufficient light from the
lamps of the two cars to illuminate the scene.
</p>
<p>Arima&#8217;s left hand still held Orme&#8217;s right forearm,
and his right hand was free to hunt for the
papers. Maku, on the other side, had meantime
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
strengthened his grip on Orme&#8217;s left arm, at the
same time raising one knee so that Orme could feel
it pressing against the small of his back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What this!&#8221; asked Arima, taking a long envelope
from the inner pocket of Orme&#8217;s coat and
holding it up for inspection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A blank contract,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;Do you
want it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Arima took the paper from the envelope and
examined it. Then with an exclamation of disgust
he replaced it in Orme&#8217;s pocket and continued his
search.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Orme calmly, &#8220;there is nothing
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Japanese, muttering in his own tongue, ran
his hands over Orme&#8217;s body and even looked into
his hat. Nothing was found.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might as well believe me first as last,&#8221; exclaimed
Orme. &#8220;The papers you want are not
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Arima was clearly puzzled. &#8220;You had them,&#8221;
he began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly. But I haven&#8217;t them now. How
would you feel if I should tell you that the young
lady and I have made this journey simply to throw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
you off the scent, and that the papers were being
delivered by another person?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I not believe,&#8221; declared Arima shortly.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Maku began to jabber at Arima, who,
after an instant of consideration, gave a quick
order to the fourth Japanese, who stood by. This
man went to the tonneau and got the prospectuses
which Orme had placed under the seat cushion.
</p>
<p>Arima snatched the papers with his free hand,
then, resigning Orme entirely to Maku&#8217;s care, and
clucking strangely, opened them.
</p>
<p>A glance sufficed. With a cry of disappointment,
he tore the papers in two and threw them to
the ground.
</p>
<p>He thrust his face close to Orme&#8217;s. &#8220;Where
the papers?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Orme did not reply.
</p>
<p>The Japanese who had brought the prospectuses
from the tonneau now stepped to Maku&#8217;s assistance,
for Orme had made a motion of the body
which showed that he was rapidly losing his
patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queek!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still no answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; The exclamation had a ring of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
triumph. &#8220;Mees have um!&#8221; He nodded toward
the car where the girl still sat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; exclaimed Orme vehemently. &#8220;She has
not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mees have um,&#8221; repeated Arima. &#8220;We hunt.
We see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you she has not,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No believe you.&#8221; Arima chuckled. &#8220;Come,
mees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Orme twisted himself around, he was enraged
to see the Japanese in the car seize the girl by the
arm and drag her to the ground. Once on her
feet, she did not resist, but permitted herself to be
led toward the little group.
</p>
<p>Arima advanced a step to meet her. &#8220;Give me
papers,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no papers,&#8221; she protested despairingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We search you,&#8221; said Arima, taking another
step toward her and extending his hands.
</p>
<p>It may be that Arima did not intend actually to
lay hands on her. His thought may have been
that the threat would induce Orme to tell where
the papers really were. But the effect on Orme
was to set him ablaze with anger.
</p>
<p>His swift, indignant purpose seemed to multiply
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
his strength until the little men who held him were
like children in his hands.
</p>
<p>A sudden jerk, and he had pulled both his arms
free. Maku and the man at his other side were
taken completely by surprise, and before they had
time to recover themselves, Orme had thrown his
arms around them and crushed their heads together
with such force that they dropped limp and unconscious
to the ground. They were out of the
fight.
</p>
<p>At the first sounds of struggle, Arima turned.
Now, as Orme charged toward him, he bent slightly
forward, every muscle tense, ready to strike or trip
or twist.
</p>
<p>His framework was overlaid by muscles that
were like supple steel. Light and quick, he had a
strength that could hardly have been inferred from
his build. And though Orme&#8217;s outbreak had been
sudden, the Japanese was apparently not in the
least disconcerted.
</p>
<p>He knew how to turn the rush of the American
into a disastrous fall. He knew how to prod with
his bony knuckle the angry man&#8217;s solar plexus&mdash;how
to step swiftly aside and bring the horny edge
of his hand against sensitive vertebrae. He could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
seize Orme by the arm and, dropping backward to
the ground, land Orme where he wished him. Yes,
Arima had every reason to feel confident. Many
a time had he got the better of American fist-fighters.
</p>
<p>But a system of offense and defense which is
based upon the turning of an opponent&#8217;s strength
against himself absolutely depends for its success
upon an accurate estimate of the opponent&#8217;s intentions.
A sudden shift of physical purpose may
put your jiu-jitsu adept at a loss.
</p>
<p>Arima, from his knowledge of American fighting
methods, had reason to think that Orme would
continue his charge and strike out with his fists
when he came near enough. That, however, is
something that Orme did not do. For, in his two
previous encounters with the Japanese, he had
learned much. He had learned, among other
things, the value of the unexpected. And though
his anger was almost blinding, he cooled, during
those few short strides, to his usual caution.
</p>
<p>Within two paces of Arima, he stopped short.
</p>
<p>For one tense moment Orme opened his senses to
all impressions. He could hear, with almost painful
distinctness, the moans of the two men he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
stunned and the rustling sounds made by their
writhings.
</p>
<p>He caught a glimpse of the girl. The searchlight
of one of the cars struck full on the side of
her face, and drew there a distinct shadow of the
network of her disarranged hair. He saw the
strained, excited look in her eyes.
</p>
<p>Her captor still held her arm. He was watching
Orme and Arima indifferently, as though quite
confident of Japanese skill.
</p>
<p>All this Orme observed in an instant. Then
his eyes were again on Arima.
</p>
<p>He knew that he would have to attack. To
await the trick holds of the Japanese would be to
invite defeat. But if he attacked, he must use an
unexpected method.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he raised his left arm above his head
and clenched his fist. His right arm remained by
his side.
</p>
<p>A step forward. The upraised arm descended.
Swiftly Arima reached upward to seize it. But
even as the one arm descended, Orme swung his
other, with terrific force, up from the waist, and
caught Arima on the mouth.
</p>
<p>The blow missed the chin, but it was hard enough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
to fell any man of ordinary strength. Arima
staggered back, past the girl, and brought up
against the side of one of the cars. But with
hardly an instant for recovery, he leaped forward
again and the man who was holding the girl also
sprang at Orme.
</p>
<p>It would be folly to meet the two. Orme turned
and ran quickly in among the trees of the little
grove. The darkness was his friend, for the pursuers
halted in their quick run and separated,
proceeding more cautiously.
</p>
<p>As for Orme, once in shelter, he stopped for
breath.
</p>
<p>He could see the two men coming toward him.
They were outlined against the radiance from the
motor-cars. Cautiously he stepped toward the
south, hoping that they would pass him in the
darkness, but he dared not move rapidly, lest a
stumble or the breaking of a twig betray him.
</p>
<p>All this time the engines of the two cars had
continued to work, and their muffled chug-chug-chug
helped to cover the noise of footsteps.
</p>
<p>What pleased him most was to see, out of the
corner of his eye, that the girl had taken advantage
of her release to climb to the chauffeur&#8217;s seat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
of the car in which Maku had brought them from
Chicago. That meant that, if he could reach the
car, they might get away. But the papers&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>By this time Orme was between his pursuers and
the road. He stopped and groped about till he
found a fair-sized stone, then worked toward the
edge of the grove. The moment was at hand to
make a dash.
</p>
<p>Ten steps would take him to the car; then a leap
into the tonneau, and off to the northward he and
the girl would speed. Pursuit would be delayed
for a few precious moments, for the Japanese
would have to turn the other car around. Those
few moments would determine the margin of success
or failure.
</p>
<p>But there were the papers. At all cost they
must be secured. The plan that flashed into
Orme&#8217;s mind was to draw the Japanese from the
spot and then, jumping from the car, let the girl
lead the pursuers on while he returned.
</p>
<p>Just as he was about to rush for the car he
heard a sound among the trees. He wheeled and
saw the dim outline of one of his enemies coming
toward him. In his excitement he had forgotten
that just as they could be seen by him when they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
were between him and the road, so he could now be
seen by them. Undoubtedly he was outlined, as
they had been, against the background of the
light.
</p>
<p>The Japanese was only a few feet away. Orme
threw the stone; by good luck it struck the man in
the stomach, and he dropped to the ground and
rolled in silent agony.
</p>
<p>But at the same moment Orme was seized from
behind, and held in a grip he could not break. Indeed,
when he tried to break it, there was a sudden,
killing strain on his spine. Then Arima&#8217;s voice
said, close to his ear:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The papers!
</p>
<p>Japanese character thus brought its fresh surprise
to Orme. Even after this hard fight, when
three of his friends lay groaning on the ground&mdash;when
he had in his power the man who had injured
them, who had temporarily bested himself&mdash;Arima&#8217;s
chief thought was still of the papers!
</p>
<p>He seemed to have none of the semi-barbarian
vengefulness that might have been expected. He
merely wished the papers&mdash;wished them the more
desperately with every passing moment. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
lives of his companions counted for nothing besides
the papers!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; repeated Arima.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t them,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;You ought to
know that by this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The answer was a torturing pressure on Orme&#8217;s
spine. &#8220;You tell,&#8221; hissed Arima.
</p>
<p>As the pressure increased Orme&#8217;s suffering was
so keen that his senses began to slip away. He
was gliding into a state in which all consciousness
centered hazily around the one sharp point of
pain.
</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, he was released. For a moment
he staggered limply, but his strength surged back,
and he was able to see how the situation had
changed.
</p>
<p>The girl had swung her car in closer to the edge
of the grove and nearer to the struggling figures.
Doubtless she had some idea of helping. But the
effect of the change in the position of her car was
to permit the searchlight of the other car to throw
its bright beam without interruption down the
road. And there, perhaps fifty feet to the southward,
gleamed something white.
</p>
<p>The girl could not see it, for her car was headed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
north. But Arima saw it, and in a flash he realized
what it was. The papers lay there at the side
of the road, where Orme had tossed them a moment
before the two cars met.
</p>
<p>There had been no other way to dispose of them.
If the car from the north had stopped at a different
angle, or if the other car had not moved, the
light would not have shone upon them, and the
Japanese might not have suspected where they
were. Or, if Orme had tossed them a few feet
farther to one side, they would have been out of
the range of the light. But there they lay.
</p>
<p>Arima leaped toward them. Even as he started,
a figure appeared at the other side of the road and
walked over toward the two cars. It was a man
with brass buttons and policeman&#8217;s helmet. He
walked with authority, and he held a stout club in
his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s goin&#8217; on here?&#8221; he demanded.
Arima stopped in his tracks.
</p>
<p>To Orme, at this moment, came the memory of
the girl&#8217;s desire to avoid publicity. &#8220;Nothing
wrong,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>The policeman stared. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been watchin&#8217;
you from over there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It looks like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
nothin&#8217; wrong, with men fighting all over the
ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little trial of strength,&#8221; explained
Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trial of strength, hey?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; admitted Orme, &#8220;this man&#8221;&mdash;pointing
to Arima&mdash;&#8220;wanted something that I had. It&#8217;s
not a matter for the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it ain&#8217;t? Somebody&#8217;s been hurt.&#8221; He
gestured with his club toward the shadows where
the three injured men were slowly coming back to
their senses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not seriously,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that later,&#8221; replied the policeman
decidedly.
</p>
<p>Orme tried to carry the affair off boldly.
Every moment of delay now threatened defeat for
him. &#8220;There is nothing serious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They
have done me no real harm. But the young lady
and I shall be obliged to you, if you will keep these
Japanese here until we can get away. They attacked
us, but I don&#8217;t wish to make a complaint
against them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The policeman showed new interest. He
glanced at Arima. &#8220;Japanese!&#8221; he exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
&#8220;There was one slugged on the campus last night.
I guess you&#8217;ll all have to come along with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; protested Orme. &#8220;Just because
somebody hit a Japanese over the head last
night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you know about that, do you? No&#8221;&mdash;as
Orme made a movement&mdash;&#8220;stand where you
are.&#8221; He drew his revolver.
</p>
<p>During this colloquy, Arima had edged nearer
and nearer to the papers. Orme&#8217;s sudden step
was involuntary; it was due to the fact that he
had seen Arima stoop swiftly and pick up the
papers and thrust them into his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; continued the policeman. &#8220;And
you, there&#8221;&mdash;he nodded toward Arima&mdash;&#8220;come
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Arima hesitated, but the muzzle of the revolver
turned toward him, and he came and stood a few
feet away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; mighty funny about this,&#8221;
continued the policeman. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just get into
one of these cars and go to the station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This man and me?&#8221; asked Orme. He had
visions of no great difficulty in satisfying the
questions of the local justice, but he knew that an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
arrest would mean delay, perhaps of hours. And
Arima had the papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that man, and you, and the woman.
I&#8217;ll send someone for the others. If you&#8217;re the
fellow that did the sluggin&#8217; on the campus last
night, you won&#8217;t get away from me again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of dragging the young lady
into this?&#8221; demanded Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None o&#8217; your business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I speak to her a minute, first?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t. There&#8217;s been too many Chicago
hold-up men around here lately, and I won&#8217;t
take chances with you.&#8221; The policeman made this
explanation apparently in deference to Orme&#8217;s appearance,
which, in spite of the evidence of struggle,
was that of a gentleman. &#8220;Looks don&#8217;t always
tell,&#8221; he continued.
</p>
<p>That the girl should be taken to the station and
held, under such suspicious circumstances was simply
not to be thought of.
</p>
<p>Doubtless she could quickly set in motion forces
that would liberate her, but the disgrace of detention
was something she must be saved from at any
cost.
</p>
<p>She was known in Evanston. Her identity once
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
established, the story of her arrest would be sure
to spread. Her position would then be the more
painful, because the circumstances of the case were
such that she was unwilling to explain them.
</p>
<p>Moreover, Orme realized that, if he and Arima
were held, the care of the girl would be his first
thought, and the recovery of the papers would be
forced into second place. That would not be according
to her wish. Assuredly, if he was to get
the papers, he could do better alone.
</p>
<p>She sat in the car, not more than six feet from
him, her face the picture of mingled emotions.
Orme saw that he must reassure her as to himself
before he carried out the plan which had suddenly
come to his mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will make a mistake, officer, if you detain
me,&#8221; he said, speaking distinctly, so that the girl
would be sure to hear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it out,&#8221; said the policeman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little telephoning will set me free in an
hour,&#8221; Orme continued, bending to pick up his
hat, which had fallen to the ground at the beginning
of the fight. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do anything except
take me to the station and find out that you
have bungled.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my affair,&#8221; said the policeman. &#8220;But
here, we&#8217;ve done enough talkin&#8217;.&#8221; He waved his
revolver in a gesture which indicated that they
were to enter the car.
</p>
<p>Now, Orme knew that the girl had not seen him
throw the papers to the road. Neither had she
seen Arima pick them up. Whatever guess she
had made as to his disposal of them, there was no
reason for her to doubt that he had again got
them into his possession, during some stage of the
struggle.
</p>
<p>He looked at her earnestly and significantly,
then smiled slightly, in the thought of reassuring
her.
</p>
<p>When he was certain that she was watching his
every move, he glanced at the car, then up the
road to the north. Then, with such quickness that
the policeman had no time to prevent, he snatched
from the inner pocket of his coat the envelope containing
the blank contract which had first disappointed
Arima, and tossed it into the tonneau.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; he shouted.
</p>
<p>Like a shot, she sent the car forward. It disappeared
swiftly into the night.
</p>
<p>Thus far, Orme was satisfied. He had got the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
girl safely away. She thought that he had thrown
the papers into the car, and when she came to examine
them she would be disappointed, but Orme
felt that she would then understand&mdash;that she
would continue to trust him.
</p>
<p>As the car darted away the policeman swung
his club at Orme.
</p>
<p>Before the blow could strike, the upraised arm
was caught by a little hand and with a quick jerk,
the policeman was pulled to the ground. His revolver,
which he held in his left hand, went off as
he fell, and a leaf, cut from a tree above by the
bullet, sailed into Orme&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>The policeman lay helpless in the cunning hold
of Maku&mdash;Maku, who, fully restored to his senses,
had crept up to save Arima from the law.
</p>
<p>Orme wondered whether the girl had heard the
shot. Probably not, for she was driving into the
wind. But he had no time to consider the point,
for Arima, suddenly conscious of freedom, leaped
for the remaining car. He had the papers; he
would hurry them safely to his master, leaving
Orme and the policeman to the mercies of his reviving
confederates.
</p>
<p>The papers were still first in his thoughts. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
why not? Orme remembered the scathing rebuke
by the Japanese minister. In the flash of thought
that preceded his own action he realized that the
recovering of the papers was Arima&#8217;s one means of
righting himself.
</p>
<p>As Arima grasped the steering-wheel of the car
and threw on the clutch, Orme ran behind the
tonneau. His action was swiftly calculated to give
the impression that he was dodging around the
car in the hope of escaping on foot.
</p>
<p>That is what Arima might have thought, had
he glanced around&mdash;what Maku might have
thought, had he done more than throw one swift
glance at Arima, then devote himself again to the
prostrate officer.
</p>
<p>But Orme, reaching upward, got his hands over
the high back of the tonneau. He hung on
tightly, raising his feet from the ground. The car
plunged forward.
</p>
<p>For a time Orme merely kept his position. The
dust whirled up in his face, and he had to close his
eyes, but he was conscious that the car was gaining
speed rapidly.
</p>
<p>The situation was as difficult as it was dangerous.
He planned nothing less than to climb into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
the car and deal with Arima even while they were
flying along the road. But he must wait until
they had gone a safe distance from the battleground.
On the other hand, he must act before
they got into the thickly settled streets of the town.
</p>
<p>He figured that they had gone about a quarter
of a mile, when he began his effort. Pulling himself
up by his hands, he peered over the back of
the tonneau. He could see Arima, huddled forward
over the steering-wheel, doubtless watching
the road ahead with a careful eye for obstacles and
for the police.
</p>
<p>For Arima was driving the car at a law-breaking
speed. Clearly, he was an adept at motoring.
But Orme did not stop to ask himself how a humble
teacher of jiu-jitsu&mdash;a professional athlete&mdash;had
acquired so much skill in the handling of a car.
</p>
<p>It proved hard to get into the tonneau. Several
times he got one leg almost over the back,
only to be dislodged as the car bumped into a
rut or over a stone. Once he almost lost his grip
entirely. But a final effort gave him a leg-hold,
and slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;he climbed over to the
leather cushions of the wide seat.
</p>
<p>If Arima now turned and saw him, almost anything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
might happen. But before he could become
conscious that anyone was near him, Orme was
crouching in the tonneau.
</p>
<p>The car was going at a thirty-five-mile clip.
The street lights were flashing by, and not far
ahead were the frequent lights of houses. Nothing
could be done here; therefore Orme got down
as low as he could. He realized that he would have
to wait till they had passed through the town.
</p>
<p>Arima had not remained on the Sheridan Road.
He had taken a street which struck off from it,
more directly southward, and Orme surmised that
the intention was to avoid the main streets of
Evanston.
</p>
<p>When the car came to a cross street and turned
westward this surmise was strengthened. They
bumped over railroad tracks. Several times they
passed other vehicles.
</p>
<p>Presently Orme raised his head and discovered
that the houses were thinning out. The car appeared
to be heading straight into the open country,
and Arima put on more speed. Forty miles
an hour was not a high estimate for the rate at
which they were traveling.
</p>
<p>For several minutes Orme continued in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
crouching position. The positions of the stars
told him that they were still going west&mdash;not south
toward Chicago. Every turn of the wheels, therefore,
was carrying him farther into unknown territory&mdash;farther
from the girl and all chance of
communicating with her. Surely he must act
soon, if he was to act at all; for Arima evidently
was proceeding to some rendezvous, where Orme
might find himself again in the midst of an overwhelming
number of enemies.
</p>
<p>But what could he do? Rapidly he turned over
in his mind the various courses open to him.
Should he try to stun Arima with a blow, and then
reach forward and take the steering-wheel before
the car could swerve into the ditch?
</p>
<p>The blow might not prove effective. In that
case, the chances were that Arima would involuntarily
swing the car to one side. Then there would
be a smash&mdash;with death or serious injury threatening
both Arima and himself.
</p>
<p>Should he try to cut a tire?
</p>
<p>The feat was almost impossible. In attempting
it, he would run great risk of premature discovery,
and even if he succeeded in the attempt, the situation
would be little changed. The necessity of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
stopping the car to make repairs might not put
Arima in his hands.
</p>
<p>The plan he at last decided upon was to throw
his left arm around Arima&#8217;s neck and draw him
straight back, trusting that he might be able to
get over the seat and set the brakes without losing
his grip. The throat of the jiu-jitsu adept is
tough, made so by patient development of neck
muscles, but Orme had a strong arm, and he believed,
moreover, that Arima would not have time
to protect himself by stiffening his muscles before
the grip was secured.
</p>
<p>The car was skimming along over the turnpike
like some flying bird of night. Orme glanced back
over the way they had come. A soft electric glow
in the sky told where Evanston lay, several miles
to the east. Far to the south a greater glow
showed the position of Chicago.
</p>
<p>Pulling himself erect, Orme leaned forward. It
seemed as though Arima must hear him breathe.
Slowly he advanced his arm. Then, darting
swiftly, he threw it around Arima&#8217;s neck and drew
backwards with a jerk.
</p>
<p>The Japanese was taken completely unawares.
Uttering a strangled cry, he let go of the steering-wheel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
and clutched at the choking arm that held
him; he could not break the grip.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Orme reached for the steering-wheel
with his free arm. But Arima, kicking frantically,
struck the wheel with his foot, just as Orme was
about to seize it. The car turned sharply to one
side. Into the ditch it plunged.
</p>
<p>As the fore wheels dropped into the depression,
the body of the car rose in the air. Orme, still
clinging to Arima, shot forward. He was conscious,
in that fraction of a second, that he must
release his hold, or Arima&#8217;s neck would be broken;
so he unbent his arm.
</p>
<p>The earth arose and something struck him heavily.
He saw a firmament of brilliant stars. Then
all was black.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A CHANCE OF THE GAME</h3>
</div>

<p>The first impression that came to Orme with returning
consciousness was one of impending disaster.
His mind was renewing its last thought
before it had ceased to work.
</p>
<p>Then he realized that the disaster had already
occurred, and he moved his arms and legs, to see if
they had been injured. They gave him no pain,
and he raised himself to a sitting position.
</p>
<p>The soft night hovered about him. He heard
confusedly the droning of insects, and the distant
mournful call of a whip-poor-will. The roar of
the car was strangely missing. What had become
of it? And where was Arima? These were
the first questions he asked himself as he became
able to think without confusion.
</p>
<p>He now became aware that his head hurt, and
raising his hand, he found a large bump under the
hair above his right temple. Turning, he discovered
that he had been thrown over the fence into
a field of thick-standing grain, which had broken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
his fall. His head must have struck the fence in
passing.
</p>
<p>He got to his feet. At first he was bothered by
dizziness, but that soon disappeared.
</p>
<p>Climbing the fence, he saw that the car had
turned over on one side. At a glance there were
no evidences of superficial damage, but it would
take a team of horses and some time to right it
and get it back into the road. The lamps had
been extinguished.
</p>
<p>In the ditch near the car lay Arima. One of
his legs was bent under him horribly. Orme hurried
over to him.
</p>
<p>The Japanese was conscious. His beady eyes
glittered wetly in the starlight, but he said no
word, gave no groan, made no show of pain.
Whatever he may have suffered, he endured with
the stoicism that is traditional in his race.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Much hurt?&#8221; asked Orme, bending over him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My leg broke.&#8221; Arima spoke unemotionally.
</p>
<p>Orme considered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you help,&#8221; he said,
at last. &#8220;Lie quiet for a little while, and you will
be looked after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He rose, smoothed out his clothing, and pulled
himself together. It was not part of his program
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
to let whomever he might meet know that he himself
had been concerned in the wreck.
</p>
<p>In a moment he returned to Arima. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
to have those papers,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Silently the Japanese reached within his coat and
drew out the papers. He held them up for Orme
to take.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have me beat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Spirit told me
I must fail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A picture of the scene in Madame Alia&#8217;s rooms
came to Orme; the darkness broken only by a pinpoint
of gaslight; the floating, ghostly forms; the
circle of awed believers, with the two Japanese, intent
as children.
</p>
<p>The medium&#8217;s work for him had not ended when
she helped him to escape. Mentally he redoubled
his thanks to her, for she had so impressed the
fatalistic mind of Arima that he gave the papers
over without making necessary a final struggle.
</p>
<p>By the size and shape of the papers Orme recognized
them. Nevertheless, to make sure that he
was not being deceived; he slid his hands over
Arima&#8217;s coat, and felt in the pockets. He found
nothing that resembled the papers he had, so he
thrust them into his own pocket.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>He now took out his watch. There was not
enough light to see what time it was, and he ran
his fingers over the dial, as he had done during
that time of imprisonment, earlier in the evening.
As nearly as he could tell it was ten minutes past
nine. He could hardly believe that it was so early.
</p>
<p>With a final, &#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; to Arima, Orme
now started down the road toward the lights of a
house, a quarter of a mile ahead.
</p>
<p>He had it in mind to examine the papers, to find
a clue to the name of the girl&#8217;s father. The sentiment
which had led him to refuse her offer to tell
him everything must now be neglected. There
might still be time to deliver the papers before
midnight, but he did not dare delay.
</p>
<p>For one thing, he had only the haziest notion as
to his whereabouts. Obviously he was somewhere
west of Evanston, but that meant little in an unfamiliar
country. He would have to find some
conveyance.
</p>
<p>Not altogether without sympathy for his fallen
enemy, he nevertheless felt that Arima had received
no more than he deserved. There had been no
hesitation about the different attacks made upon
himself. He had provoked no assault unless by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
the fact that he had the marked bill in his possession.
But the calmness with which Arima had endured
his final defeat aroused admiration. After
all, the Japanese had merely acted under orders.
And now Orme&#8217;s first thought was to get help for
him.
</p>
<p>He came to the lights he had seen. They shone
through the windows of a small farmhouse a few
rods back from the road. A short avenue of poplars
led to the door.
</p>
<p>In response to Orme&#8217;s knock, the man of the
house appeared&mdash;a German with sleepy eyes and
tousled yellow hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an injured man down the road a
way,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;Motor-car smash.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His leg is broken, I think. I made him as
comfortable as I could. Can you get a doctor?
The man will rest quiet till a doctor comes. He
can&#8217;t be moved very well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ein</i> doctor? <i>Ja. Es ist</i> one <i>bei</i> Niles Center.
<i>Mein</i> son vill go for him. Too bad! Too
bad! Come in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Orme carelessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vas you in <i>der</i> accident?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look it?&#8221; Orme laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Nein</i>, you do not look it. <i>Ach!</i> Dese autymobles!
Dey makes much harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> too bad,&#8221; admitted Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He vas a millionaire, maybe. Dey comes by
here so fast, going to Arradale. Hans! <i>Komm
Hier! Ein</i> man is gesmashed. <i>Du</i> must for <i>der</i>
doctor go.&#8221; He turned back to Orme. &#8220;<i>Mein</i>
son, he will go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Orme had no ears for what the sympathetic
German said. One word had made his heart leap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arradale!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There he was to have dined with Tom and Bessie
Wallingham! He had forgotten them utterly.
Were they still at the golf club? Possibly, and,
in any event, if he could reach the club, he would
be near a railroad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is Arradale?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Halb</i>-miles. <i>Und</i> vere did you say <i>der</i> hurt
man vas?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A few hundred feet back there.&#8221; Orme indicated
the direction. &#8220;Can I reach Arradale by
this road?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next turn&mdash;<i>rechts</i>. I will take de man some
<i>schnapps</i>.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That will be good. His friends will make it
right with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ach!</i> Do not say so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The German shook his head in deprecation of the
idea that he wished any return for his services.
Meantime his long-legged, towheaded son had come
from within and stood gaping behind his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vill you go back to <i>der</i> man <i>mit</i> me?&#8221; asked
the German.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So? Vell, all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t wait,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
done what I could, and I have a long way to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Dat&#8217;s all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then thank you very much. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme walked briskly to the road and turned
west. He felt assured that Arima would be looked
after.
</p>
<p>Following the road to the first crossing, he
turned to the right. In a few minutes he saw the
lights of the clubhouse, and a little later he
stepped upon the veranda.
</p>
<p>Many people were seated in the comfortable
porch chairs. The charms of the summer evening
had held them after their afternoon of play. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
from one of the groups came the sound of a voice&mdash;a
man&#8217;s voice&mdash;which Orme found vaguely familiar.
He could not place it, however, and he quickly
forgot it in his general impression of the scene.
</p>
<p>In this atmosphere of gayety he felt strangely
out of place. Here all was chatter and froth&mdash;the
activity of the surface-joy of living; but he
had stepped into it fresh from a series of events
that had uncovered the inner verities.
</p>
<p>Here the ice tinkled in cool glasses, and women
laughed happily, and every one was under the spell
of the velvety summer evening; but he had looked
into the face of Love and the face of Death&mdash;and
both were still near to his heart.
</p>
<p>He found a servant and asked for the Wallinghams.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Wallingham has left, sir,&#8221; said the man,
&#8220;but Mrs. Wallingham is here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask her if Mr. Orme may speak to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled rather grimly as the servant departed,
for he anticipated Bessie&#8217;s laughing accusations.
</p>
<p>And presently she came, an admonishing finger
upheld.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert&mdash;Orme,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;how dare
you show your face now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it, Bessie. Honest, I couldn&#8217;t.
I must ask you to forgive and forget.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a hard request, Bob. You have broken
two engagements in one day&mdash;and one of them for
dinner. But never mind. I have a weakness that
I acquired from Tom&mdash;I mean the weakness of believing
in you. Go ahead and explain yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take too long, Bessie. Please let me
put it off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Until you can manage a good excuse? You
want all the trumps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My explanation is all tangled up with other
people&#8217;s affairs. Where&#8217;s Tom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He went back to the city early&mdash;awfully sorry
that he couldn&#8217;t stay to have dinner with you.
There is a committee or something this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bessie, you know what I asked you over the
telephone. Can you&mdash;can you help me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;<i>Now?</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Bob, what&#8217;s the matter with you? This
is no time of day to make a call.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very important, Bessie. It doesn&#8217;t concern
the young lady alone. I simply must be at
her house within the next two hours.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>She eyed him earnestly. &#8220;If you say that, Bob,
I must believe you. And, of course, I&#8217;ll help all
I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme sighed his relief. &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>She flashed a speculative glance at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I can&#8217;t tell you
what it&#8217;s all about. You&#8217;ll just have to take my
word for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I asked you to tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you marvel of womanhood. You are dying
of curiosity, I don&#8217;t doubt, but your restraint
is superhuman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again she looked at him keenly. &#8220;Bob, you
are dying of curiosity yourself. Don&#8217;t you suppose
I can see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something harder than curiosity,&#8221; said
Orme simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How eager are you!&#8221; She laughed. &#8220;Now,
there is plenty of time. The trip won&#8217;t take us
more than half an hour; so come along and meet
some friends of mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bessie&mdash;if you <i>could</i> hurry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t start until the car comes. I&#8217;m expecting
it at any moment. So be good, and come
along. There&#8217;s such an interesting man&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
very distinguished. We don&#8217;t try to pronounce
his name. Just think, he was engaged for dinner
here, also, and came too late. And ever since he
arrived he&#8217;s been called to the telephone at five-minute
intervals. So exciting! Nobody can
guess what he&#8217;s so busy about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She threaded her way through the lively groups
on the veranda, and reluctantly he followed. The
voice which he had so nearly recognized sounded
closer, then stopped with a curious little laugh
that was loudly echoed by others.
</p>
<p>Bessie broke in upon the lull that followed.
&#8220;Excellency, may I present another man who
missed his dinner?&#8221; she said saucily. &#8220;Mr.
Orme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man addressed was sitting comfortably in
a wicker chair that was several sizes too large for
him. At the mention of Orme&#8217;s name he got to
his feet with startling alacrity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr.&mdash;<i>Orme</i>?&#8221; His surprise was unmistakable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Robert Orme,&#8221; said Bessie.
</p>
<p>Someone struck a match to light a cigar, and
in the sudden light Orme found himself looking
into the face of the Japanese minister.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have never met you before,&#8221; said the
minister slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; replied Orme.
</p>
<p>He was much disquieted by the encounter.
Now he understood that Arima had been bound for
this very place.
</p>
<p>If only he had refused to let Bessie drag him
into her circle! The minister would not have
known his face, but the mention of his name gave
full enlightenment.
</p>
<p>The minister resumed his seat, and a chair was
brought for Orme. There were other introductions.
</p>
<p>A woman&#8217;s voice renewed the conversation.
&#8220;Excellency, won&#8217;t you tell us another of your
very interesting stories?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The minister turned to her. &#8220;I will tell you
one,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you will not find in the literature
of my country. It is a story of the secret
service, and it came to me through my personal
acquaintance with some of the participants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be splendid!&#8221; exclaimed the
woman.
</p>
<p>The minister waited for a moment. He turned
his face toward Orme, and asked politely: &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
will not mind listening to what I have to say, Mr.
Orme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, to be sure not,&#8221; replied Orme, wondering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My stories are not always short,&#8221; continued
the minister, &#8220;as the others already know. But
they sometime hold meanings which, in my country,
at least, would be perfectly plain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After this odd bit of by-play, he began his
narrative:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a man who lived in the city of Takamatsu,
on the island of Shikoku. His name was
Kimaga, and he was much respected by all who
knew him, for he was painstakingly devoted to his
aged and mos&#8217; honorable parents. By trade he
was a maker of vases&mdash;a&mdash;what you call him&mdash;a
potter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One day while Kimaga was walking upon the
road, he saw before him on the ground a letter.
He picked it up. It was sealed, but he discovered
upon the outside a curious writing which he could
not make out. In fact, Kimaga could not read at
all. He was very poorly educate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Kimaga was charm by the grace and
beauty of the writing. Though he could not read
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
it, it fascinated his eyes. He decided to keep it,
making no attempt to find the rightful owner.
You must know that in Nippon beauty is worship
by the humblest workman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It happened that the letter had been written
by a Chinese spy, and it contained a report concerning
our fortifications. Now there is in Nippon
a very secret service. It is not responsible to
the government. It is compose of nobles who for
many and many a generation have bound themselves
by a strong oath to do patriotic service
which the government itself might be too embarrassed
to undertake. If they are oblige to use
extreme measures, and are arrested because of
what they have done, they calmly accept the punishment
of the law without explaining their actions.
Sons of noble houses have been executed
for assassinating secret enemies of Nippon, and
they have met this fate as their oath demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Members of this secret service knew about this
letter of the Chinese spy. They knew, also, that
it had been lost, and before long they learned that
Kimaga had picked it up. How they learned all
this does not matter. But they also knew that the
relations between Nippon and China at the time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
were of such a strain that their government, not
wishing to give cause of war, would hesitate to
punish the Chinese spy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime Kimaga had become so enamor
of the letter that he could not bear to let it
go out of his possession. When he was alone he
would feast his eyes upon the beautiful writing.
But it was not long before he discovered that men
were watching him, and he became filled with fear.
Why should he be watched? Had he done a guilty
thing?
</p>
<p>&#8220;So greatly did the fear swell in him that he decided
to take the letter back to the place where he
had found it, and drop it again in the road. But
when he got to the place and looked for a last time
at the writing, it give him such longing to keep it
that he thrust it into his breast again and hurried
back to his shop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That night a man came to see Kimaga.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are you Kimaga, the maker of vases?&#8217; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kimaga, all trembling, replied that he was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then,&#8217; said the man, &#8216;I have come to you
with high purpose. You have a letter which does
not belong to you. Give it to me.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Does it belong to you?&#8217; asked Kimaga, his
desire putting armor on his fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That is not to be asked,&#8217; replied the man. &#8216;I
am <i>samurai</i>. For the glory of Nippon you mus&#8217;
give me the letter.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Kimaga did not wish to let the letter go.
&#8216;How do you know that I have it?&#8217; he said. &#8216;You
have not seen it.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is enough that I know,&#8217; said the man.
&#8216;Three days I allow you. If by then the letter
has not been placed on the altar of the war-god,
in the shrine of Samiya, then you will be assassinated.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With that the man went away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kimaga was now almos&#8217; dead with fright.
For the first day he did nothing but weep. The
second day he put on mourning and set his affairs
in order. The third day he held the letter in his
hand for many hours and filled his mind with the
beauty of the writing. He could not give it up.
Rather would he die. And at last he placed it in
a lacquer box and buried it deep at the foot of
the largest cherry-tree in his garden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He arose to go back into his house, an&#8217; his
head was bowed over with terror. You see, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
felt that many eyes were watching him from the
near-by walls, an&#8217; he thought he heard breathings
and the whispers of strangers. What should he
do now? He dare not advance; he dare not stay
where he was. So exceeding affrighted was he
that he groaned aloud. From all about him came
groans that answered his. Once more he groaned,
and once more his ears were filled with the answers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he took one step toward his house.
Nothing happened. He took another step, an&#8217;
his knees they shook like the palsy. The breathings
an&#8217; whisperings seem, oh, so much nearer now.
But he muster all his strength an&#8217; put out his foot
for the third step. It did not reach the ground
again before the vengeance struck him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next morning his wife found him dead.
His head had been severed from his body.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The minister stopped and sat back in his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How awful!&#8221; exclaimed the woman who had
asked for a story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; said the minister affably. &#8220;In serving
my country, such things mus&#8217; be done. Kimaga
should have given the letter. Don&#8217;t you
think so, Mr. Orme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The parable was quite clear to Orme. He understood
the threat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In America,&#8221; he said, drily, &#8220;we do not worship
penmanship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But an American might for other reasons keep
a letter that did not belong to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if he was honorable. His natural course
would be to see that it was delivered to the person
for whom it was intended. Certainly he
would not give it to any man who could not prove
his right to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would he not? But if he were told that he
mus&#8217; die&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case he would inform his friends of the
threats against him, and they would see that his
murderers were hanged. Assassination is not popular
in America, Excellency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme did not attempt to conceal the contempt
in his words, and several of the listeners moved in
their chairs, betraying their embarrassment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, then, Mr. Orme,&#8221; said the minister,
&#8220;you could favor us with a story which would show
the attitude of an American in such an affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme laughed. &#8220;Oddly enough,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I
can give you just such a story&mdash;if you all care to
hear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; murmured one of the men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It happened to a friend of mine,&#8221; said Orme.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
&#8220;He had in his possession a number of proxies,
the use of which would determine the control of a
certain corporation. While he was carrying these
proxies to the country-house of the man to whom
he was to deliver them, he was attacked by a man
who was acting for another faction. This man
secured the advantage over my friend and, robbing
him of the proxies, jumped into a waiting motor-car
to make his escape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And did he escape?&#8221; the minister interrupted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought himself safe,&#8221; continued Orme,
&#8220;but my friend had caught the back of the motor-car
just as it started. He climbed silently into the
tonneau, and throwing his arm around the neck of
the thief, pulled him backward from his seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The car was ditched, and my friend and the
thief were both thrown out. My friend was not
hurt. The thief, however, had his leg broken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened then?&#8221; inquired the minister;
for Orme had paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my friend took the proxies from the
thief&#8217;s pocket and walked away. He stopped at
the nearest farmhouse and sent help back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even in America,&#8221; commented the minister,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
&#8220;the frien&#8217;s of the injured man might see that his
hurt was avenge. The man who caused the accident
should be made to suffer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;If the matter were
pressed at all, the correct thing to do would be to
arrest the man with the broken leg. He had
stolen the papers in the first place. Harm came
to him, when he tried to escape with the papers
after stealing them. But as a matter of fact, the
average American would consider the affair at
an end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your story and mine are dissimilar,&#8221; remarked
the minister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. But they involve a similar question:
whether a man should yield passively to a
power that appears to be stronger than his own.
In America we do not yield passively unless we
understand all the bearings of the case, and see
that it is right to yield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment a motor-car came up the drive.
&#8220;There&#8217;s our car, Bob,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;Wait a
moment, while I get my wraps. I know that you
are impatient to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that you are a good friend,&#8221; he whispered,
as she arose.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></p>
<p>He did not care to remain with the group in
Bessie&#8217;s absence. With a bow, he turned to stroll
by himself down the veranda. But the minister
jumped to his feet and called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Orme!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme looked back. &#8220;Please be so good as to
return,&#8221; continued the minister.
</p>
<p>With mere politeness, Orme halted, and took a
step back toward his chair.
</p>
<p>An air of startled expectancy was manifest in
the positions taken by the different members of the
group. The minister&#8217;s voice had sounded sharp
and authoritative, and he now stepped forward a
pace or two, stopping at a point where the light
from one of the clubhouse windows fell full on
his face. Clearly he was laboring under great excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have something to say to me?&#8221; inquired
Orme. He foresaw an effort to detain him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am compelled to ask the ladies to leave us
for a few minutes,&#8221; said the minister, seriously.
&#8220;There is a matter of utmos&#8217; importance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bowed. The women, hesitating in their embarrassment,
rose and walked away, leaving the
half-dozen men standing in a circle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I find myself in an awkward position,&#8221; began
the minister, slowly. &#8220;I am a guest of your club,
and I should never dream of saying what I mus&#8217;
say, were my own personal affairs alone involved.
Let me urge that no one leave until I have done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a tense moment he was silent. Then he
went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, while we were talking together here,
I had in my pocket certain papers of great importance
to my country. In the last few minutes
they have disappeared. I regret to say it&mdash;but,
gentlemen, someone has taken them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a gasp of astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mus&#8217; even open myself to the charge of abusing
your hospitality, rather than let the matter
pass. If I could only make you understand how
grave it is&#8221;&mdash;he was brilliantly impressive. Just
the right shade of reluctance colored his earnestness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have every reason to think,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;that the possession of those papers would be of
immense personal advantage to the man who has
been sitting at my right&mdash;Mr. Orme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a serious charge, Excellency,&#8221; exclaimed
one of the men.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware of that. But I am obliged to ask
you not to dismiss it hastily. My position and
standing are known to you. When I tell you
that these papers are of importance to my country,
you can only in part realize how great that
importance is. Gentlemen, I mus&#8217; ask Mr. Orme
whether he has the papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme saw that the minister&#8217;s bold stroke was
having its effect. He decided quickly to meet it
with frankness. &#8220;The papers to which His Excellency
refers,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;are in my
pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Several of the men exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Orme went on, &#8220;I did not take them
from His Excellency. On the contrary, his agents
have for some time been using every device to steal
them from me. They have failed, and now he is
making a last attempt by trying to persuade you
that they belong to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I submit that this smart answer does not satisfy
my charge,&#8221; cried the minister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really wish to go further?&#8221; demanded
Orme. &#8220;Would you like me to explain to these
men what those papers really mean?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you do that, you betray my country&#8217;s secrets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme turned to the others. &#8220;His Excellency
and I are both guests here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Leaving
his official position out of the question, my word
must go as far as his. I assure you that he has no
claim at all upon the papers in my pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not true!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s words exploded in a sharp staccato.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this country,&#8221; said Orme, calmly, &#8220;we
knock men down for words like that. In Japan,
perhaps, the lie can be passed with impunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I ask that Mr. Orme be detained,&#8221;
exclaimed the minister furiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not be detained,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>The other men were whispering among themselves,
and at last one of them stepped forward
as spokesman. &#8220;This is a serious matter for the
club,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I suggest, Mr. Orme, that we go
to the library&#8221;&mdash;he glanced significantly at the
other groups on the veranda&mdash;&#8220;where no one can
overhear us, and talk the matter over quietly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that will exactly fit in with his scheme,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
exclaimed Orme, heatedly. &#8220;He knows that, in
the interests of our own country&#8221;&mdash;he hazarded
this&mdash;&#8220;I must be at a certain place before midnight.
He will use every means to delay me&mdash;even
to charging me with theft.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; Bessie Wallingham&#8217;s voice
broke in upon them. &#8220;Is anyone daring to accuse
Bob Orme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In her long, gray silk motor-cloak, with the
filmy chiffon veil bound about her hat, she startled
them, like an apparition.
</p>
<p>The spokesman explained. &#8220;His Excellency
says that Mr. Orme has stolen some papers from
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then His Excellency is at fault,&#8221; said Bessie,
promptly. &#8220;I vouch for Mr. Orme. He is Tom&#8217;s
best friend, and Tom is one of the governors of
the club. Come, Bob.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned away decisively, and Orme recognized
the advantage she had given him, and strode
after her. From noises behind him, he gathered
that the men were holding the minister back by
main force.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE GOAL</h3>
</div>

<p>The chauffeur was opening the door of the waiting
car. It was a black car&mdash;a car with strangely
familiar lines. Orme started. &#8220;Where did that
come from?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>Bessie smiled at him. &#8220;That is my surprise for
you. My very dear friend, whom you so much desire
to see, telephoned me here this evening and
asked me to spend the night with her instead of returning
to Chicago. She promised to send her car
for me. It was long enough coming, goodness
knows, but if it had appeared sooner, I should,
have gone before you arrived.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme understood. The girl had telephoned to
Bessie while he waited there on La Salle Street.
She had planned a meeting that would satisfy him
with full knowledge of her name and place. And
the lateness of the car in reaching Arradale was
unquestionably owing to the fact that it had not
set out on its errand until after the girl
reached home and gave her chauffeur the order.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
Orme welcomed this evidence that she had got
home safely.
</p>
<p>Bessie jumped lightly into the tonneau, and
Orme followed. The car glided from the grounds.
Eastward it went, through the pleasant, rolling
farming country, that was wrapped in the beauty
of the starry night. They crossed a bridge over
a narrow creek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would hardly think,&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;that
this is so-called North Branch of the Chicago
River.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would believe anything about that river,&#8221;
he replied.
</p>
<p>She laughed nervously. He knew that she was
suppressing her natural interest in the scene she
had witnessed on the veranda; yet, of course, she
was expecting some explanation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bessie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am sorry to have got into
such a muss there at the club. The Japanese minister
was the last man I wanted to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps your friend&mdash;whom we are now going
to visit&mdash;will explain things a little,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;I can tell you only that I had in my pocket certain
papers which the Jap would have given much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
to get hold of. He tried it by accusing me of
stealing them from him. It was very awkward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand better than you think,&#8221; she said,
suddenly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, you big stupid, that
I know where we are going? That tells me something.
I can put two and two together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I needn&#8217;t try to do any more explaining
of things I can&#8217;t explain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. You are forgiven all. Just
think, Bob, it&#8217;s nearly a year since you stood up
with Tom and me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How time does go! See&#8221;&mdash;as the car turned
at a crossing&mdash;&#8220;we are going northward. We are
bound for the village of Winnetka. Does that tell
you anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all,&#8221; said Orme, striving vainly to
give the Indian name a place in his mind.
</p>
<p>On they sped. Orme looked at his watch. It
was half-past ten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be nearly there,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s only a little way, now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were going eastward again, following a
narrow dirt road. Suddenly the chauffeur threw
the brakes on hard. Orme and Bessie, thrown forward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
by the sudden stopping, clutched the sides
of the car. There was a crash, and they found
themselves in the bottom of the tonneau.
</p>
<p>Orme was unharmed. &#8220;Are you all right, Bessie?
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; Her voice was cheery.
</p>
<p>He leaped to the road. The chauffeur had
descended and was hurrying to the front of the
car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; asked Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone pushed a wheelbarrow into the road
just as we were coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A wheelbarrow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. There it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme looked at the wheelbarrow. It was wedged
under the front of the car. He peered off into the
field at the left. Dimly he could see a running
figure, and he hastily climbed the rail fence and
started in pursuit.
</p>
<p>It was a hard sprint. The running man was
fast on his feet, but his speed did not long serve
him, for he stumbled and fell. He did not rise, and
Orme, coming up, for the moment supposed him to
be stunned.
</p>
<p>Bending over, he discovered that the prostrate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
man was panting hard, and digging his hands
into the turf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; commanded Orme.
</p>
<p>The man got to his knees and, turning, raised
supplicating hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poritol!&#8221; exclaimed Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Orme, spare me. It was an accident.&#8221;
His face worked convulsively. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Something
like a sob escaped him, and Orme again found
himself divided between contempt and pity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing with that wheelbarrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poritol kept his frightened eyes on Orme&#8217;s
face, but he said nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will explain it. You followed the car
when it started for Arradale. You waited here,
found a wheelbarrow, and tried to wreck us. It is
further evidence of your comic equipment that
you should use a wheelbarrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poritol got to his feet. &#8220;You are mistaken,
dear Mr. Orme. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme smiled grimly. &#8220;Stop,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
explain. Now I want you to stay right here in
this field for a half hour. Don&#8217;t budge. If I catch
you outside, I&#8217;ll take you to the nearest jail.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></p>
<p>Poritol drew himself up. &#8220;As an <i>attaché</i> I am
exempt,&#8221; he said, with a pitiful attempt at dignity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not exempt from the consequences
of a crime like this. Now, get on your knees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whimpering, Poritol kneeled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay in that position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sir&mdash;oh, my very dear sir. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay there!&#8221; thundered Orme.
</p>
<p>Poritol was still, but his lips moved, and his
interlaced fingers worked convulsively.
</p>
<p>As Orme walked away, he stopped now and then
to look back. Poritol did not move, and Orme
long carried the picture of that kneeling figure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; asked Bessie Wallingham, as
he climbed back over the fence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A puppy with sharp teeth,&#8221; he replied, thinking
of what the girl had said. &#8220;We might as
well forget him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She studied him in silence, then pointed to the
chauffeur, who was down at the side of the car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything damaged?&#8221; Orme queried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Much?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hours&#8217; work, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; Orme shut his teeth down hard;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
Poritol, had he known it, might have felt thankful
that he was not near at hand. He turned to
Bessie. &#8220;How much farther is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The chauffeur answered. &#8220;About three miles,
sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Three miles over dark country roads&mdash;and it
was nearly eleven o&#8217;clock. He glanced ahead. In
the distance a light twinkled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bessie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come with me to that farmhouse.
We must go on. Or, if you prefer to wait
here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They walked along the road to the farm gate.
A cur yelped at their feet as they approached the
house, and an old man, coatless and slippered,
opened the door, holding an oil lamp high above
his head. &#8220;Down, Rover! What do you want?&#8221;
he shouted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to have a rig to take us to Winnetka,&#8221;
said Orme. &#8220;Our car broke down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man reflected. &#8220;Can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he said,
at last. &#8220;All shet up fer the night. Can&#8217;t leave
the missus alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A head protruded from a dark upper window.
&#8220;Yes, you can, Simeon,&#8221; growled a woman&#8217;s guttural
voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wall&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you can.&#8221; She turned to Orme. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
take ye fer five dollars cash. Ye can pay me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme turned to Bessie. &#8220;Have you any
money?&#8221; he whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens! I left my hand-bag in my locker
at the clubhouse. How stupid!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind.&#8221; Orme saw that he must lose
the marked bill after all. Regretfully he took it
from his pocket. The woman had disappeared
from the window, and now she came to the door
and stood behind her husband. Wrapped in an
old blanket, she made a gaunt figure, not unlike a
squaw. As Orme walked up the two or three steps,
she stretched her hand over her husband&#8217;s shoulder
and snatched the bill, examining it closely by the
lamplight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this writin&#8217; on it?&#8221; she demanded,
fiercely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s just somebody&#8217;s joke. It doesn&#8217;t
hurt anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She looked at it doubtfully,
then crumpled it tight in her fist. &#8220;I guess
it&#8217;ll pass. Git a move on you, Simeon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man departed, grumbling, to the barn,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
and the woman drew back into the house, shutting
the door carefully. Orme and Bessie heard the
bolts click as she shot them home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospitable!&#8221; exclaimed Bessie, seating herself
on the doorstep.
</p>
<p>After a wait that seemed interminable, the old
man came driving around the house. To a ramshackle
buggy he had hitched a decrepit horse.
They wedged in as best they could, the old man
between them, and at a shuffling amble the nag
proceeded through the gate and turned eastward.
</p>
<p>In the course of twenty minutes they crossed
railroad tracks and entered the shady streets of
the village, Bessie directing the old man where
to drive. Presently they came to the entrance
of what appeared to be an extensive estate. Back
among the trees glimmered the lights of a house.
&#8220;Turn in,&#8221; said Bessie.
</p>
<p>A thought struck Orme. If Poritol, why not
the Japanese? Maku and his friends might easily
have got back to this place. And if the minister
had been able to telephone to his allies from Arradale,
they would be expecting him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Let me out. You
drive on to the door and wait there for me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span></p>
<p>Bessie nodded. She did not comprehend, but she
accepted the situation unhesitatingly.
</p>
<p>Orme noted, by the light of the lamp at the gate,
the shimmer of the veil that was wound around her
hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your veil,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>She withdrew the pins and unwound the piece
of gossamer. He took it and stepped to the
ground, concealing himself among the trees that
lined the drive.
</p>
<p>The buggy proceeded slowly. Orme followed
afoot, on a parallel course, keeping well back
among the trees. At a certain point, after the
buggy passed, a figure stepped out into the drive,
and stood looking after it. From his build and
the peculiar agility of his motions, he was recognizable
as Maku. Orme hunted about till he found
a bush from which he could quietly break a
wand about six feet long. Stripping it of leaves,
he fastened the veil to one end of it and tip-toed
toward the drive.
</p>
<p>The Japanese was still looking after the buggy,
which had drawn up before the house.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of the darkness a sinuous gray
form came floating toward him. It wavered, advanced,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
halted, then seemed to rush. The séance
the afternoon was fresh in the mind of the Japanese.
With screams of terror, he turned and fled
down the drive, while Orme, removing the veil
from the stick, moved on toward the house. Madame
Alia&#8217;s game certainly was effective in dealing
with Orientals.
</p>
<p>A moment later Orme and Bessie had crossed
the roomy veranda and were at the door, while
the old man, still grumbling, swung around the
circle of the drive and rattled away. Orme&#8217;s
heart was pounding. When the servant answered
the bell, he drew back and he did not hear the
words which Bessie spoke in a low voice. They
were ushered into a wide reception-hall, and the
servant went to announce them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wish to see her alone,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;Go
in there and I will arrange it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went as she directed, into a little reception-room,
and there he waited while subdued feminine
greetings were exchanged in the hall without.
Then, at last, through the doorway came the
gracious, lovely figure of the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I knew you would come,
dear&mdash;I knew.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></p>
<p>He took her hands and drew her to him. But
with a glance at the doorway she held herself away
from him.
</p>
<p>In his delight at seeing her he had almost forgotten
his mission. But now he remembered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the papers,&#8221; he said, taking them from
his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sure you had them. I was sure that you
would come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laid them in her hands. &#8220;Forgive me, Girl,
for fooling you with that blank contract.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed happily. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t look at it
until I got home. Then I was so disappointed that
I almost cried. But when I thought it over, I
understood. Oh, my dear, I believed in you so
strongly that even then I went to my father and
told him that the papers were on the way&mdash;that
they would be here in time. I just simply <i>knew</i>
you would come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Regardless of the open doorway he clasped her
closely, and she buried her face in his coat with
a little laugh that was almost a sob. Then, suddenly,
she left him standing there and, holding the
papers tight, went from the room.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A SAVED SITUATION</h3>
</div>

<p>He waited impatiently for her return. Bessie, he
knew, might be in one of the rooms just across
the hall, but, though Bessie was a trump, he did
not go to look for her. The girl might come
back at any moment&mdash;and he did not wish to miss
one instant of her presence.
</p>
<p>Again he considered the miracle of her appearance
in his life, and he rejoiced that, from the
first, he had been able to be of service to her. Those
loving, trusting words that she had just spoken&mdash;how
they glowed in his heart! She had known that
he would succeed! He could only think that the
secret telegraphy of his love had sent her messages
of confidence.
</p>
<p>And yet he did not even know her name. The
house was just such a one as he might have
imagined to be her home&mdash;beautiful, with the air
of a longer family tradition than is commonly
found in the Middle West&mdash;unobtrusive but complete.
And the furnishings of the room in which
he was standing were in quiet but perfect taste.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></p>
<p>On a table near him lay a book. Mechanically
he picked it up.
</p>
<p>It opened at the fly-leaf. Something was written
there&mdash;her name, perhaps.
</p>
<p>He closed the cover without reading the inscription,
conscious only of a line of writing in a feminine
hand that might be hers or another&#8217;s. No,
he could wait. The name did not matter. She was
his, and that was enough.
</p>
<p>Near the book lay an empty envelope, addressed
to&mdash;he averted his eyes.
</p>
<p>He found himself wondering whether Poritol
was still kneeling in the field, and whether Maku
was still running, and whether the Japanese minister
was still telling charming stories on the
porch at Arradale.
</p>
<p>And presently, when she came again, her face
radiant, and said softly, &#8220;You have done a great
thing, my dear&#8221;&mdash;when she said that, he could
only look and look and thank Heaven for his
blessedness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were the papers when you fooled me
into leaving you?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arima had them. It&#8217;s quite a story, Girl,
dear.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then, wait a little while,&#8221; she interrupted;
&#8220;we have permission to see the papers signed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A smile of mischief alone betrayed her recognition
of his bewilderment.
</p>
<p>Why should the signing be treated as a matter
of such importance? It must mean a great deal
to her and hers. The hour was now about half-past
eleven, and he remembered that in a short time
it would have been too late.
</p>
<p>She led him through the adjoining room and
to the curtained doorway of a library&mdash;long, alcoved,
shelved with books, and furnished with
heavy leather chairs. In the center was a large
table of polished mahogany, upon which rested a
reading-lamp.
</p>
<p>The glow of this lamp illuminated the forms and
faces of a group of serious-faced men&mdash;two seated,
the others standing. In the golden light, with the
dim background of shelves, surmounted here and
there by a vase or a classic bust, the group impressed
Orme like a stately painting&mdash;a tableau
distinguished by solemn dignity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are to remain here and keep very quiet,&#8221;
whispered the girl.
</p>
<p>Orme nodded. His eyes were fixed on the face
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
of a man who sat at the table, a pen poised in his
hand. Those strong, straight features&mdash;the eyes,
with their look of sympathetic comprehension, so
like the girl&#8217;s&mdash;the lips, eloquent in their calmness&mdash;surely
this was her father. But Orme&#8217;s heart
beat faster, for the face of this man, framed in
its wavy gray hair, was familiar. He seemed to
know every line of it.
</p>
<p>Where had he seen this man? That they had
never met, he felt certain, unless, indeed, they had
shaken hands in a casual and forgotten introduction.
</p>
<p>Or was he led into a feeling of recognition by
the undoubted resemblance of father to daughter?
No, it could not be that; and yet this man,
or his picture&mdash;ah! The recognition came to
Orme in a flash.
</p>
<p>This was the magnetic face that was now so
often appearing in the press&mdash;the face of the
great, the revered, the able statesman upon whom
rested so great a part of the burden of the country&#8217;s
welfare. No wonder that Orme recognized
it, for it was the face of the Secretary of State!
And the girl was his daughter.
</p>
<p>Orme was amazed to think how he had failed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
to piece the facts together. The rumors of important
international negotiations; the sudden but
not serious illness of the Secretary; his temporary
retirement from Washington to Chicago, to be
near his favorite physician&mdash;for weeks the papers
had been full of these incidents.
</p>
<p>When South Americans and Japanese combined
to hinder the signing of mysterious papers, he
should have realized that the matter was not of
private, but of public importance. But the true
significance of the events into which he had been
drawn had escaped his logical mind. It had never
occurred to him that such a series of plots, frequent
though they might be in continental Europe,
could ever be attempted in a country like the
United States. And then, he had actually thought
of little besides the girl and her needs.
</p>
<p>He glanced at her now, but her gaze was fixed
on the scene before them. The brightness of her
eyes and her quickened breathing told him how
intense was her interest.
</p>
<p>Across the table from the Secretary of State
sat a younger man. His breast glittered with
decorations, and his bearing and appearance had
all the stiffness of the high-born Teuton.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span></p>
<p>Of the men who stood behind the two seated
figures, some were young, some were old, but all
were weighted with the gravity of a great moment.
Orme inferred that they were secretaries
and <i>attachés</i>.
</p>
<p>And now pens scratched on paper. The Secretary
of State and the German Ambassador&mdash;for
Orme knew that it must be he&mdash;were signing
documents, apparently in duplicate, for they exchanged
papers after signing and repeated the
action. So these were the papers which at the
last hour Orme had restored; and this was the
scene which his action had made possible&mdash;all
for the sake of a girl.
</p>
<p>And when the last pen-stroke had been completed
and the seated men raised their eyes and
looked at each other&mdash;looked at each other with
the responsible glance of men who have made history&mdash;at
that moment the girl whispered to Orme:
&#8220;Come,&#8221; and silently he followed her back to the
room in which he had first awaited her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Girl,&#8221; he whispered, as she turned and
faced him, &#8220;Oh, Girl, I am so glad!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled. &#8220;Please wait for a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she had disappeared he repictured the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
scene they had just witnessed. With all its absence
of pomp, it had left with him an impression that
could never be effaced.
</p>
<p>Again the girl appeared in the doorway, and
leaning on her arm was her father. Orme stepped
forward. The Secretary smiled and extended his
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Orme,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we owe you much. My
daughter has told me something of your experiences.
You may be sure that I had no notion,
when this affair began, that she would have to envelop
herself and others in so much mystery, but
now that all has ended well, I can only be thankful.&#8221;
He seated himself. &#8220;You will excuse me;
I am not quite strong yet, though, as I might
say, very convalescent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was leaning on the back of her father&#8217;s
chair. &#8220;Tell father the story, won&#8217;t you, please?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>So Orme quickly narrated the series of events
that began with his stroll along State Street the
afternoon of the day before. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound
true, does it?&#8221; he concluded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the marked five-dollar bill will always be
evidence of its truth,&#8221; said the girl; and then,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
with a suggestion of adorable shyness, &#8220;We must
go and redeem that bill sometime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Secretary was pondering. He had listened
with manifest interest, interrupting now and then
with questions that helped to bring out salient
points. At the report of the conversation between
Alcatrante and the Japanese concerning the commissions
on ships, he had leaned forward with
especial attention. And now, after a few moments
of thought, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Japanese minister we can handle. As for
Alcatrante, I must see to it that he is recalled&mdash;and
Poritol.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little Mr. Poritol!&#8221; exclaimed the girl.
&#8220;Do you think he is still kneeling in that field?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; said Orme, smiling. &#8220;We will
look to see when we go to redeem the bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Mr. Orme,&#8221; said the Secretary, &#8220;that
I may fairly give you a little clearer insight into
the importance of the papers which you rescued
for us. You have seen stories of the rumors of
negotiations with some foreign Power?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Orme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, perhaps you have not known of the secret
but aggressive policy which Japan has lately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
adopted toward us. The exchange of friendly
notes a few years ago might as well not have occurred.
If we had done nothing to check the
tendencies in the Pacific, we should have been at
war within another year. Only a complete understanding
and definite agreement with some
strong nation could prevent hostilities. The Anglo-Japanese
alliance eliminated Great Britain
as a possible ally. There were reasons why it
seemed inadvisable to turn to France, for an arrangement
there would involve the recognition of
Russian interests. Therefore, we sought an alliance
with Germany.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The German Ambassador and myself drafted
a treaty last month, with the proviso that it must
be signed within a certain period which, as you
know, will expire within a few minutes. My illness
followed, and with it the necessity of coming
to our home, here. I had expected to return to
Washington last week, but as Doctor Allison forbade
me to travel for a while longer, I had the
drafts of the treaty sent on, and urged the German
Ambassador to pay me a long-deferred visit.
He and his suite have been here several days, in
mufti.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Orme, this treaty concerns two
important relations&mdash;a just balance of power in
the Pacific and a just arrangement by which the
countries of South America can be made to live
up to their obligations. I cannot go into details,
and it will be some months before the treaty will
be made public&mdash;but Japan must not dominate our
Pacific trade routes, and the Monroe Doctrine
must be applied in such a manner that it will not
shelter evil-doers. You understand now why Alcatrante
and the Japanese minister were working
together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite clear,&#8221; said Orme. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish
you to tell me any more than is advisable, but the
Japanese minister said that, if the new treaty
should lapse, the German Government would not
renew it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; said the Secretary. &#8220;The German
Ambassador is pleased with the treaty. After
it had been drafted, however, and after his home
government had agreed to the terms, Japan
brought pressure to bear in Germany. The result
of this Japanese effort&mdash;which contained a counter-proposition
for the isolation of Russia&mdash;was
that the German Government weakened&mdash;not to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
the point of disavowing the arrangement with us,
but in the event of a redrafting of the treaty, to
the adoption of a less favorable basis of negotiations,
or, possibly, even to the interposition of such
obstacles as would make a treaty possible. You
can see how essential these papers were to us.
There was not time to provide new copies, for the
lost drafts carried certain seals and necessary signatures
which could not be duplicated on short
notice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the German Ambassador know of the
loss?&#8221; Orme was encouraged to ask questions by
the Secretary&#8217;s obvious desire to explain as fully
as he could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one knew of it, Mr. Orme, excepting my
daughter and myself&mdash;that is, no one besides the
South Americans and the Japanese. It seemed
wise to say nothing. There were no secret service
men at hand, and even if there had been, I
doubt if they would have acted as efficiently as you
have acted. The police, I know, would have bungled,
and, above all else, publicity had to be
avoided.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As things have turned out, I am glad that
Poritol set his burglar on us when he did; otherwise
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
Maku would have got the treaty at the last
moment. Alcatrante&#8217;s desire to secure a diplomatic
advantage over the Japanese was really the
saving of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Secretary paused. His face lighted up with
a rare smile. &#8220;Above everything else, Mr. Orme,
I thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He arose and rang for a servant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I know you will
excuse me if I return to my guests. My daughter
will bring you in presently, so that we may have
the pleasure of making you acquainted with them.
And, of course, you will remain with us till to-morrow.&#8221;
He smiled again and went slowly from
the room on the arm of the servant.
</p>
<p>Orme turned to the girl. Her face was rosy and
her eyes were fixed on the arm of her chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl, dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can hardly believe
that it is all true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not answer, and while he gazed at her,
surprised at her silence, failing to understand her
sudden embarrassment, Bessie Wallingham appeared
in the doorway and stood hesitant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I still not wanted?&#8221; said Bessie, roguery
in her voice. &#8220;Sure, ye&#8217;ll find me a faithful servant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
I minds me own business and asks no questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl rushed over to her friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bessie,&#8221; she cried, with a little laugh&mdash;&#8220;Oh,
Bessie, won&#8217;t you please come in and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Orme began to understand. &#8220;And wait for us
a little longer,&#8221; he broke in.
</p>
<p>Masterfully he led the girl out through the
doorway to the hall.
</p>
<p>Bessie Wallingham looked after their retreating
figures. &#8220;Well? I never!&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
